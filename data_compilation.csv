"I didn’t have the worst childhood in the world, I had a roof over my head, always had a hot meal, could shower and clean my clothes whenever I wanted.",0
Girls have been so fucking mean to me my entire life.,0
It takes very little to send me down a spiral where I feel like life isn’t worth it anymore.,1
I just feel like every day I wake up into a nightmare and it just repeats everyday slowly kicking the shit out of my will to live.,1
"I wanna be respected like my sisters, but nobody respects me.",1
It seems like the burden is lighter now.,0

it's been bad.,1
I feel like everytime I get close I get friend zoned.,0
"I guess I have a good life, I'm very lucky to be considered attractive, I'm popular, always been selected to be in the highest grade football team, unlike some people on here who complain about being lonely or how they think they deserve are monsters because they have never kissed a girl.",0
* Tried to ask others out.,0
My very complicated personality mixed with my standing with my peers led to depression.,1
My friend has talked to them and says that they want to talk it out but despite how close I am to all of them I just don’t feel that I can really fix this by talking even though I know it’s probably all my fault.,0
But now i'm thinking that probably wouldn't help it would just be dragging another person into my stupid issues.,1
All my peers are thriving and living their lie adulting hile I'm over here weeping over my miserable ife.,1
"I feel so stupid knowing that friends are around me but every night I get so lonely and desperate and I hate myself with every single fibre of my being and I’d be better off dead but I’m too scared of feeling any more pain
I used to only feel depressed at night and that was almost bearable 
But this is too much and I don’t know how much of this I can take 
For almost a year I’ve been so desperate to be with someone: to have that comfort of company and validation is all I want, and it’s taken over my life and my interactions with people.",1
I feel selfish and gross for not being able to be there to help them bc of my own condition.,1
The daily hurt and not wanting or having the energy to leave your bed.,1
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong but every night when my head hits the pillow I can’t stop thinking about it.,0
I just stopped caring about things and it kinda scares me but gotta keep going am i right?,0
"We must experience enough of the pain before we understand who we really are, which is pure energy, pure light.",0

I was 100% sure I was going to fail and was thinking about suicide a lot.,1
I finally got a supervisor job only to realize i suck at it.,0
Sure there are little bits of other things in between but overall the vast majority of life is just work and sleep.,0
I don't want to sound like a creep but i'm genuinely interested in making people happy.,0
And frankly everything costs money or is illegal so what is even the point.,0
I had just invited her into my nightmare.,1
"At best, I will just stop caring about my shitty life.",1
"Well to get to the point I just don't feel good and I don't see myself getting over her death, it's so difficult wanting to talk to her and not being able to.",1
People who are depressed OR people who are depressed with a dark sense of humor (me),1
I am 23 years old (I am 5'4 and weigh 120 lbs) and I never get approached and men pretty much never flirt with me and I have never even had a guy ask for my number before.,1
I never have guys start conversations with me or small talk.,0
It's really been getting me down and making my self esteem low to the point that when I am in my room I literally start crying and cannot continue to study anymore (I am in college) and get really depressed because I hear other women getting male attention or interest but I never seem to get any indication that a guy is attracted to me or wants romance with me.,1
"Yes, it may seem crazy that I cry and get depressed but I want to find love like everybody else.",1
I cry almost everyday because I don't understand what is wrong with me-why no one likes me?,1
I don't know if I have depression or something but this is literally something that really gets me feeling really sad and down because I just feel and believe like I am 100% going to end up all alone for the rest of my life because no one expresses interest in me.,1
"Almost everyday, I (M18) am becoming so much more depressed and unhappy.",1
There are a few reasons as to why I am this way and they all constantly cause me to lose my motivation.,1
"It all started recently, roughly at the beginning of this month.",0
"The first and biggest reason is that, my current ex-girlfriend of one year and two months broke up with me.",0
Permanently.,0
"We had already taken a long break with each other, prior to us splitting up and I hoped that she was ready to be committed and rekindle our love.",0
"Sadly I was mistaken, as we broke up once again only this time, for it to be permanent.",1
I love(d) her so much and it is the main reason as to why I bave had these negative thoughts.,0
The second reason is my bad health.,0
"Constant headaches and receiving treatment on my brain, because of an unfortunate incident that occurred three years ago, which lead me to my second brain hemorrhage.",0
It frustrates me so much because it prevents me from doing the things I want to do.,0
I get upset that I don't have the capability to do the things that I enjoy as I'm being restricted by my bad health.,1
"I also lack the motivation to do my college work, as I am not enthused and have so much bigger issues to worry about.",1
"I always find myself slacking and procrastinating majority of the time, as I feel as though the purpose of studying is just pointless.",1
I just want to end my life because this has been happening for so long.,1
"I don't see myself getting any better and I don't know if I can continue living life like this anymore, I don't know what to do.",1
"Any suggestions to make light of the situation will be grateful, thanks in advance!",0
Would you be content with absolute nothingness.,1
Of course you wouldn't.,0
You come from a state of awareness.,0
This consciousness is your everything.,0
Take that away and you have nothing not even having.,0
Why do you have to lose it at death.this is the cruelest.,1
I would hate it if there were no life after death.that was the ultimate hope medieval people had while going through the hell of living.,1
Can’t help but feel stupid shit.,1
"Can’t help but fucking run my self insane when those same stupid ass fuck feeling come back to bite me, haunt me.",1
Can’t see the goddam signs right in front of my face.,0
Can’t do anything fucking right.,1
What are some better ways to cope with anger rather than inflicting self harm or having constant panic attacks?,1
I need some help..,1
"I'm really not sure where to post anymore because people can be so mean, but I just really really miss my dog.",0
I know I'm suffering  temporary depression and I'm sure so many  of you are battling something way more difficult.,0
But this is just sucking the life outta me.,1
I’m a waste of space.,1
I’m a failure at everything I try to enjoy.,1
I have no outstanding traits about me.,1
I try to be positive.,0
I try to be optimistic about my future.,0
"“Time heals, things will get better.” That’s bullshit.",1
It never does.,0
"All I ever try to do is make the ones around me happy, I don’t ask anything in return.",0
"I try to improve myself through my own hard work in the things I do, I never get any results.",0
All of my peers look like they all have something great ahead of them in life.,0
I don’t see anything but pitch black in my future.,1
I try to do the best thing and try to stay positive.,0
But I can’t anymore.,1
"In the end, nothing has changed.",0
"I want help, but no one really cares.",1
"I’m just going to be told “you might have depression”, “there are people who want to help you”, “go see a doctor”, blah blah blah.",1
"Yeah you’re probably right, maybe I am depressed.",0
There’s people who want to help?,0
"Like who, the doctor?",0
A therapist?,0
Ofcourse they want to help.,0
After they get paid.,0
They care more about the money in your pocket than your damn feelings.,0
I just don’t care anymore for trying to become better.,1
"I don’t think it’s me, it sounds like me but I’m double thinking?!",0
"One person is saying: 
“I really don’t want to go to work”
“I really just want to die” 
“I hate everything” 
“Just kill me” 
And going over somewhat of a ‘plan’ I’ve thought over a million times to end it all.",0
"The other is trying to fight, writing this post, trying to actually do something about how I feel.",0
"I’m struggling though.. I’m struggling to be motivated, I have some positive thoughts in an instant and lose interest from lack of motivation in a second.",1
"Everything is a front, I try so hard to normalise myself when I feel so out of control...",0
"I feel like I’m being teased, trying to seek help is taking months, I’ve only spoken to a GP about my situation but still 6 months on antidepressants and I haven’t seen a psychiatrist; the tease is if I do something and allow my brain to take over, 1: I may actually succeed this time and 2: if I don’t, I’ll end up speaking to one in hospital!",1
Why is this world literally pushing me out?,1
I feel like it doesn’t want me here anymore,0
😢😢😢😢😢🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻,0
Sweating profusely.,0
"Wasn't really that warm, but my body was soaked.",0
"I was scared, I didn't really know what was going on.",0
I ran out of hard booze the night before and had to make-do with a few leftover sleep meds.,1
"But the alcohol is king, and if I'm sober too long, I just start to feel it.",1
"All the emotions, all of the pain.",1
I can't even escape them in my sleep.,1
"The dreams are so vivid, so powerful.",1
"I can feel them in my very core, it's almost like my mind just wants to hurt me.",1
Like it just wants me to fucking feel all the pain conscious or unconscious.,1
"I often wake up crying, confused.",1
Not able to discern dream from reality.,0
"Neither is good, though, so I guess it doesn't really matter.",0
"Throughout the day, booze is the only thing that keeps me from being nearly incapacitated with emotion.",1
The days are getting longer.,1
"That's not a bad thing entirely, I still have a lot to do, and I'm on bided time.",0
"Only problem is longer days just mean more chance for thought, and thought is the last thing I want.",1
I've been watching my life deteriorate over the past couple weeks of my worst depressive happening ever.,1
"By my own hand, of course.",0
"I have great support, amazing friends and all the opportunity in the world.",0
But I don't want it.,0
I don't fucking want any of it.,0
I've done things I'm not sure I can forgive myself.,0
"I've hurt, I've manipulated for my own selfish gain, and I've changed as a person entirely.",0
I haven't chosen to actively off myself.,0
"I've chosen to do it slowly, and painfully.",0
"Not necessarily physical pain, though there is enough of that as well.",1
"Just watching everything I've built over the past several years fall apart, and drift into a figurative coma of self-loathing and hate.",1
"Quit my job, gave up the reptile collection I've built and cherished so much over the years, they don't deserve to suffer just because of me.",0
"Selling everything I own, losing friends left and right.",1
I'm watching it all fade away in front of me.,0
"I never drive now, haven't driven in days.",0
No reason to risk the lives of others because of my own poor decisions.,0
"I've hurt enough, I've ruined enough.",0
Nobody else needs to suffer because of me.,0
Except me.,0
"Sometimes I will cross-fade at night, but it basically turns into a 1hr cry session and the same song on repeat until I pass out.",1
"I don't do it every night, I only do it when I really feel like I deserve it.",0
"Honestly, I'm afraid.",0
I'm actually fucking *terrified* of myself and my own mind.,1
"When I look back and see the things I've done over the past several years, those I've hurt.",0
It makes me so angry.,0
"I just want to yell at myself in the mirror and say ""who the FUCK are you, get OUT of my FUCKING life!""",1
but I can't.,0
"That person in the fucking mirror is me, and I can't stand it.",0
What happened?,0
Why did I do it?,0
I don't know anymore.,0
I don't want to think.,0
I just want them to go away.,0
So I keep them locked away in my own mind.,0
Keep myself locked away.,1
"I keep them suppressed with the booze, the pills.",1
"You can't hurt anyone anymore, I'll make sure of it.",0
I need to talk about this.,0
"I’ve been having a hard time with it, and I need to talk about it.",0
"About 7 months ago, June 2018, my girlfriend [F18] broke up with me.",0
We were together for 9 months.,0
We met in September 2017.,0
"She was the first girl to actually love me...all the girls in high school used me for sex, so meeting her was like meeting an angel.",0
She was the sweetest person I’ve ever met.,0
"She was a virgin, hadn’t even had her first kiss.",0
She wanted to wait for intercourse until she was married aswell.,0
I was cool with that.,0
"Well, she fell in love with me so much, that she changed her mind and actually asked if we could.",0
At the time we were dating for 7 months.,0
"I asked if she was sure, she didn’t need to rush it, but she said she was.",0
"So, I took her virginity.",0
That was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made in my life.,0
"Anyway, we did everything together.",0
"We went to Homecoming, Prom, I went to her birthday, her graduation, we spent Christmas together, etc.",0
I hadn’t been that happy in years.,0
I spent so much time and money with her.,0
"Unfortunately, instead of my 100% focus being on our relationship, I had 90% focus on getting her to not hate me, and the other 10 percent on us.",0
I was terrified of her hating me for no reason because so many people have left me in my life.,1
I’m afraid of loss and abandonment.,0
So that started to affect the way I treated her.,0
"Combine that with the fact that, my graduation was coming up, I was jobless, and we were talking about getting married and moving in together, my stress levels were sky high.",0
So I started to become verbally abusive.,0
"I’ve always had anger problems, but it was starting to get worse around May.",0
I got so angry at my Mom I slammed my phone on the ground.,0
"She saw it, and told me if I didn’t start treating her better and get anger management, she’d leave me.",0
"I said I would...but, I procrastinated.",0
I didn’t think it was a big deal.,0
And I certainly didn’t think she’d leave me.,0
She did.,0
"I think in her mind, she thought if I she left me, it would encourage me to get help.",0
It didn’t.,0
It made me depressed.,1
I hated it.,0
I felt horrible.,1
We still stayed friends for god sake and that made it worse.,0
"Finally I kept going down this downward spiral, and during a phone call with her, I lost it.",0
Looking back....I’m not sure what the hell happened.,0
It was like a mixture of sadness and anger with myself.,0
"I called her a bitch, and other names, and I called her dad a bitch aswell.. She hung up, said she didn’t wanna talk to me for a long time.",0
"She blocked me, and I kept finding ways to get around it.",0
I was lost.,0
I wasn’t me anymore.,0
"The last time I talked to her, she called me insane and said if I ever contacted her or her family again she would file a restraining order.",0
And she said she’d stay mad at me for the rest of my life.,0
I didn’t contact her after that.,0
It’s been 7 months since the breakup.,0
And 4 since I last talked to her.,0
And I still haven’t gotten over it.,0
"I became so depressed that I left my hometown and am now 1,000 miles across the country with no idea of what the hell I’m doing here.",1
I hate knowing I took her virginity.,0
Because she could’ve lost it to someone so much better.,0
"That, is what hurts me the most.",0
"And I hate knowing that we did so much together, and it could’ve been saved if I just fucking manned up and got help.",0
But now it’s wasted.,1
I hate knowing she hates me.,0
I’m fucking depressed.,1
I should be over it but I’m not.,1
I’m an asshole.,0
I’m well aware of that.,0
I just wish I could’ve done better.,1
I loved her so much.,0
"She was my angel and now because of my mistakes, it’s fucked.",1
"So many friends forget me or leave me behind, I wonder if it is my fault sometimes, did I do something wrong?",1
"They used to say message whenever you want but now they just never reply or ignore my messages, it's like I'm wiped from thier memories and it makes a crater in my chest.",1
"I never enitiate conversations because of my anxiety and I get all these plots or thoughts in my head like "" What if they're busy"" or ""Maybe they don't want to talk to you anymore"" I know it's my mind playing with me but I cannot help it and it breaks me.",0
"I want new friends, but I want ones who remember me and want my company... Is that alot to ask....?",1
Im so tired of this life.,1
Every day i wake up its a stuggle to leave my bed.,0
When i see my friends i feel like i just dont relate to them or they just dont care about me at all.,1
I go into work to do the same mundane routine over and over each day and i feel like im going no where in life.,1
I never finished school or even got my drivers license and im about to be 22.,0
When ever i go around people i have to pretend to be who they think i am some sorta funny guy who just says things to make people laugh.,0
"No one sees my strugle really, mostly because people see that im responsible and can get things done easily so no one worries about me or see that i barly have things held together.",0
I just want to be happy again and not constantly think about my death.,1
I feel like some people will see this and not care and some might care.,0
"I just needed to shout out how i feel to the abyss of the internet , its easier to do this instead of bottleing it up.",0
We had a contest in college for Best Manager... And it was basically 4 rounds that were extremely easy and all that was required was to talk about stuff...,0
But I got tongue tied and awkward and kept hesitating and biding my time that I got eliminated in the 2nd round itself....,0
I'm soo embarrassed....this always happens...,0
I realized i have zero confidence and its like this giant lump in my throat that I can't get rid of is holding me back....,0
I'm so mad at myself cause I honestly feel like I could ve won the thing but I just.,0
Couldnt.,0
Get.,0
The words.,0
Out....,0
I feel helpless and don't know how I'll get out of this or even if I ever will.... Could someone help me?,1
I feel so awful and keep regretting how dumb I acted and stuff like this keeps happening...,0
"Sometimes I wonder why everyone around me manages the be so happy, they get everything they want, get the girl/guy of their dreams and live happily ever after.",0
It don't make sense to me.,0
"I've had a lot of shit go on at the moment, I've got teachers bullying me, and I'm in trouble right now for headbutting one of my so called friends for making fun of my dreppresion and anxiety.",1
"My nan might die aswell, so a lot of stuff on my plate.",1
"Going back to the guy/girl of someone's dreams, this is one of the main parts that eating away at me.",1
"About 2 months ago (may seem like a long time to some but for me this shit means the world) I ,somehow, managed to go out with a girl so amazing in my eyes.",0
"Everytime I saw her, my chest felt like nothing, having her close brightened up every aspect of my life.",0
She broke up with me because of reasons that she didn't want to tell me...I see this girl almost everyday at school.,0
"I've tried to avoid her because honestly, seeing her cripples me.",1
"I, right now am struggling with everything to do with her.",0
The part with me headbutting a so called friend for making fun of my mental health has taken a toll too.,1
This kid is part of my group at school and a lot of people think that he is the most innocent person to ever walk the earth.,0
"He's been making digs at me for the past 2 years and because of the comment on my mental state, I snapped.",0
"Because of me headbutting the kid, I've lost pretty much all of my friends because the all think he's done nothing wrong.",1
Bear in mind my group consist of around 4 or 5 people...I now have one person I can go to and talk to.,1
"Right now, my entire world is falling apart, loosing friends, family, and the people I wanted to be with forever....at this moment in time I don't know what to do with myself.",1
I've thought of talking up and taking part in the #imstillaman as Well.,0
"I kniw some of you on here might think my problems are miniscule compared to some things in life, but I honestly just needed to find a way to let everything go before I breakdown...if anybody has even read all of this, thank you for listening to me.",1
It feels like the world doesn’t exist outside.,1
It feels like everything sits still.,1
Everything feels surreal.,1
I feel like I’m in a bubble.,1
Like time stopped yesterday.,1
And thinking about people feels like memories.,1
Not there but once were.,0
I feel so alone.,1
I feel numb.,1
I feel regret.,1
I want to get up but I’ve forgotten how to function.,1
I need to distract my mind but everything seems like too much effort.,1
The boredom is painful.,1
I wish I could just sleep.,1
But I’ll just wake up to the same thing tomorrow.,0
Today is my 19th birthday and I don’t want to be on this earth anymore.,1
"Tell me some stories about your birthday, funny/good/bad.",0
Thanks!,0
Why?,0
I see no reason.,0
I've done nothing to deserve it.,0
I've done nothing to earn it.,0
"So why am I always so crushed when I find out ""friends"" have been hanging out without me; when I go out of my way to make plans and someone has to cancel, leading to the whole thing falling apart.",1
Why do I deserve love?,1
"Oh thats right, because I look like a potato on the outside and the inside isn't much better, and my kind of people don't deserve love.",1
We simply deserve a life of misery and loneliness.,1
Or maybe we simply don't deserve life at all.,1
Edit: I'm not suicidal.,0
Just tired of feeling completely and utterly alone.,1
"So i'm a 20 year old male in his 2nd year of uni in the UK


These past few weeks have probably been the worst of my life.",0
I live in a flat with two of my mates.,0
At night we always sit and watch TV go out drinking or other typical uni stuff.,0
However this past month.,0
I have lost all my motivation and life.,1
I started not going into uni and just staying in my room.,1
These past few days i haven't even been able to leave my bed.,1
My flat mates just think i'm i'll or something.,0
I think about suicide alot and just cant see what my future is.,1
Thinking that it'll be easier just to end it.,0
Not going to my uni lectures has now put me so far behind that i cant even imagine what it would be like going in now.,0
I've fucked it up to much now and it's snowballed into this huge thing.,0
I just don't know what to do.,0
Who to reach out to.,0
I just want it to end.,0
Because i'm stuck in bed i feel like a lazy shit who deserves all of this.,1
I recently met this girl who's mates with my mates girlfriend and we got along really well.,0
I thought we clicked.,0
She was making body contact and we spent the while weekend together.,0
It was probably my happiest couple of day ever.,0
but when i asked her out she said we should just be friends.,0
I feel like this really didn't help my head space.,1
"(Don't worry i'm not an incel, don't blame her for not wanting to go out with some one like me)


The worst part is that i'm pretty good at hiding these things and no body really knows that i feel this way.",0
"My parents live a 4 hour and £100 train ride away and whilst they love me, i'm not really sure if they would understand this whole mental health thing.",1
I'm just at a loss as of what to do and don't see a way out of this all.,1
It’s the same shit everyday isn’t it?,1
"You wake up feeling tired , go to school or work , finish homework or any other paper work, eat, stay up too long scrolling through reddit and listening to music and then sleep.",1
"It’s the same everyday

Does anyone else feel like their life is stuck on repeat?",0
I mean once you realise it you kind of feel like there’s no point in life.,1
I dont know if this is like universal with people with depression but dose anyone feel like in their chest theres nothing?,1
when i feel emotions i guess i feel them in my chest but a lot of the time i dont feel anything and it feels like theres nothing there.,1
is this common + whats it called?,0
"For example, about a month ago I was put on medication and it was helping a lot, I was able to do stuff.",0
"Then I went in to see the psychiatrist again and he told me that was really great improvement, especially because my dose is low , and thats not typical.",0
Then we doubled my dose.,0
Now Ive been taking the higher dose and Ive felt like shit the last 2 days Ive been on it.,0
"Before I would usually only get depressed late at night, now its all the time.",1
I cant see how this would be a result of changing the medication since Im just taking more.,0
I think I subconsciously became more depressed because I should feel that way and my improvement was abnormal.,1
"It sounds really stupid to type it out, but I feel like this is also how I started getting depressed in the first place.",1
Had a friend who was and just kept reading about it and stuff from other people who had it and eventually I could relate and then it kept getting worse.,0
I feel like this same concept could apply to me for something like anxiety or bipolar.,1
I keep reading about it and I feel like it could eventually manifest itself.,0
"I have very mild symptoms of anxiety, prb a normal amount but I cant help but feel like Im going to get worse.",1
I kind of feel like mental illness can be contagious to a degree and a big part of it is placebo and tricking your mind,1
I.....,0
Okay so my birthday is nearly 2 days.,0
"The 27th, this Saturday.",0
I need someone to talk to.,1
"I love myself as a person, but I hate my life a therapist isn't helping and my life is upside down and my boyfriend left 2 and half weeks ago and all I want is just someone to tell me it'll be okay because for the past two days I can't stop crying.",1
I....,0
I have a lived a life filled with traumatic experiences and I just... No one knows my story and it's really shitty.,1
No one is answering their phone right now and I want to spread my legs like I do every night since I was 9.,0
But I am tired of feeling numb and pain.,1
I just want to feel good again.,0
"Feeling worthless, terrible parent.",1
"SO is off at job interviews, doing a great job at it, should be landing one soon.",0
"Always staying positive, working hard, helping out around the house on top of it all.",0
I can't move from the couch.,0
Got up long enough to make pancakes for my teen.,0
Getting dressed is near impossible.,0
The thought of a shower doing my hair is so overwhelming.,0
I can manage but only when I have to.,0
I'm alone all day.,0
"Too much anxiety to leave the house, I can't remember faces and names, my memory is awful I'm afraid to do any thing because of that.",1
Even just doing laundry is over whelming.,0
"House is basically clean, but barely.",0
I can barely hold it together.,0
I'm so tired and fatigued all the time.,1
I don't know how to break this cycle.,0
I just want to be normal again.,1
It's been years.,0
"I'm 20 lbs over weight (not really that bad I know) so no clothes fit, so getting dressed is near impossible, everything is uncomfortable.",0
I have thyroid issues I can't get diagnosed properly.,0
Body hurts all the time.,0
"I'm talking my meds, but it just doesn't seem to be working.",0
Can't remember the last time I enjoyed anything.,1
I just don't know how to fix me.,0
I wish I had a buddy to do things with for motivation.,1
"I have no passion, nothing interests me anymore.",1
"LTDR: I can't get off the couch, I'm worthless, I don't know how to break the cycle.",1
Don't know how to find a passion.,1
"I have a lot of people that claim we’re best friends, but I’m never invited to anything, nobody ever asks to hangout with me, nobody tries to text me out of nowhere, and in general I feel socially neglected.",1
"All of this extends to dating too, because lately girls have been really iffy about being interested in me when it used to be easier.",0
"I don’t feel like I’ve changed in any bad way, I’m into a lot of newer shit but that’s it.",0
I just want to stop.,0
"I don’t know what I mean by that, but I just really want to stay where I am right now.",0
"In my bed, scrolling through Reddit hours on end as I anticipate school tomorrow.",0
"Seeing places like this make me happy, because there really isn’t anyone trying to come onto here and say “everything is going to be okay”.",0
I hate that cheesy shot.,0
"The kids I go to school with all do the most retarted (actual definition, not insult way) crap and it makes me slouch everyday, giving up on humanity more and more.",1
"Yes, when I talk about school I mean like I’m 13.",0
“I’m so young where I probably just have teen depression” no.,1
I had 6 friends in my life who I had known for my whole life.,0
"Then my parents decide to move about 20 minutes away from my house halfway through 5th grade, and one of my friends decides to move in across from me.",0
"I started going to a private school an hour away from my house in 6th grade, and 4 of my 6 friends decided to bail on me, not their fault though.",0
"I still have 2 friends left, and I barely even talk to them, even the one across from my street.",1
I don’t want to lose them.,0
"They love football, I’m lazy and inactive.",0
"When I tell my parents I want to go back to the school I would’ve gone to with my friends, they say “oh you have a higher iq than normal people so that’s a good school for you”.",0
Bullshite.,0
"I don’t like the kids there, and you could consider the teachers my friends because I don’t really talk to anyone else.",1
"I’ve pleaded with my mom and dad to go to a different school, but they just ignore me.",0
"I wish I could cry, but I’m so accustomed to just keeping it in that I almost literally cannot cry about it, also because I feel like I’m not special at all because of how much people are more depressed than me about worse stuff.",1
They want me to graduate from this school.,0
I’d rather attempt suicide one more time and actually be successful than do that.,1
"There’s NOTHING ahead for me in life, and no “you’re too young” bull crap, because I’ve tried to think about something actually helpful to the community that I could do, not helpful to McDonald’s.",1
"I am expected to go to college, my sister is at college, and my brother is in 11th.",0
"I feel like even if I did find something, my parents wouldn’t like what field of whatever I would want to be in, and disapprove of it.",0
"I feel like should stop this once my cat dies, because I feel, no I KNOW that my cat is the last thing that I’m not teetering off the edge of loosing.",0
I think I’ll chicken out of it at the last second cause I’m weak.,0
"I know my parents are gonna get angry at me if I told them I had my phone upstairs, and I was up till 4.",0
"I can’t tell anybody anything, because if I do my mom will probably get me another physiologist or whatever they’re called, but I still am really bad at not saying that stuff.",0
"It’s gotten to the point where when I say something serious about my depression, people write it off as a joke because they know I joke about that kinda stuff.",1
I guess I’m kinda happy that they do so I don’t have to see a phy-whatever again.,0
Don’t say stupid stuff in the comments like “don’t joke about suicide” “it’ll get better soon” or “stay happy” etc.,0
I’m ranting on here because I feel like this is a place where people don’t feel obliged to say that sort of stuff.,0
"Whatever, thanks for listening to me for the -20000 that’ll actually read this instead of getting bored of my adhd (and add too) and depression fueled rambling.",1
I’ll see you some other day reddit peeps.,0
A while back I somehow came across a Kardashian (idk which one) interview while scrolling through the channels on TV.,0
This woman was absolutely perfect.,0
"Her hair, eyes, lips, mannerisms, etc all seemed exceptional, but even then I wasn't too jealous or envious of her.",0
My thoughts back then were focused somewhere on true perfection being slightly and unexpectedly flawed.,0
An acquired taste that not everyone would stick around to bare.,0
So I almost turned the channel and moved on until she spoke a sentence that has clung to me ever since.,0
An eye opening revelation.,0
"Something along the lines of, ""...I've always felt comfortable in my body (and life).",0
"Not being comfortable as myself is something I can't even begin to fathom.""",0
It fucking floored me and it continues to floor me day after day.,0
"It reminds me that, through all my struggles, challenges, hardships, bad days, good days, triumphs, heart breaks, sadness, everything, there are people in this world who exist and have no idea of my baggage.",0
People that can't even begin to understand.,0
People you talk to everyday and they always expect something of you.,0
"They expect you to be perfect or cheerful or positive or what have you, yet fail to realise that it might just be a miracle that I continue at all.",0
People that expect you to go to college and get a degree and make money and stop being so shy and be more assertive and try harder..,0
I'VE TRIED ENOUGH.,0
I've tried for so long and so hard.,0
"I've been stuck in a race- one lap behind the rest of the competition, and I've jogged my ass off to catch up to the rest.",1
"But even though my legs are stiff and my lungs are on fire, I don't get a medal or any kind of recognition for getting last place.",1
"I get a pat on the back and a, ""Good luck next time pal.""",0
I wish I could feel comfortable in my life.,1
I wish my shoes would fit; I'm so tired of trying to grow into them.,0
I know that I want to die and would be happy if I committed suicide but I'm too weak to do it.,1
I know I can't go on day after day depressed.,1
Day after day wanting to end it all.,1

My whole life I’ve been telling myself that “you will be hurt in your life just deal with it, it will make you stronger ” but oh boy was I wrong... so I’ve had this friend for a while and I felt like me and her were really close... I’m bi so it wasn’t so hard to believe that I would fall for her, I mean she was (and still probably is) really beautiful and kind hearted, but the thing that really broke my heart was finding out that she was a really religious person who thought that any form of “Gay People (including me) were sinners and shall be sent to the pits of hell” now I found that out when we met up at a mall and I was planning to ask her to be my girlfriend(now let me tell you that she kinda made me believe in love and was starting to help me get better with my anxiety and depression “situation”) when she started to tell me about her Gay brother and how she thought he was gross and that her family disowned him, and that really broke my heart so when I told her that I was Bi... she slapped me and told me that I would burn in hell... no hesitations...she just...slapped me.",1

"I don't eat breakfast, and lately, it's a struggle to even eat lunch.",1

"My family wouldn’t have money problems, since they would have less stuff to pay.",1
"Say it outloud ""I can do this.""",0
and then theres the night where they pressured me to talk about my boyfriend.,1
NO MATTER WHAT AND YOU CAN ALWAYS BE BETTER.INTERNALLY OR EXTERNALLY THERE IS ALWAYS AKWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT.YOUR HIGHER SELF WANTS YOU TO ASCEND.THE SITUATION YOU ARE IN RIGHT NOW IS MEANT TO BE.IT IS SUPPOSE TO SERVE YOU OR TEACH YOU.YOU ARE NOT READING THIS WHOLE THING BY COINCIDENCE YOU ARE MEANT TO SEE THIS AS A SIGN THAT YOU ARE LOVED UNCONDITIONALLY.PLEASE BELIEVE AND REMEMBER I LOVE AND ACCEPT YOU COMPLETELY I DONT CARE HOW YOU LOOK INSIDE AND OUT.,0
"in the end of that episodes I'm ashamed of what I did, and I get depressed.",1
All I do is hurt the ones I love.,1
I just want this to go away and to be better already; it's so exhausting.,1
The only thing that keeps me going are my two dogs.,1
"I’m thinking about drawing again, trying new things to help my moral.",1
I’ve chosen to report and I’ve not reported others.,0
I just started my senior year in college im 32 btw .,0

Here is a backstory.,0
"If offing myself is the way to be heard, maybe I should do it.",1
Luckily I had 40k saved up in my bank account just because I was smart enough to live as cheap as possible.,0
It would push her over the edge and I couldn’t leave knowing that.,0
"I'm going to miss having a family, having a little brother.",1
I feel better just getting this off my chest.,0
"I can't get anything done, I don't want to get out of bed most of the time.",1
I'm always self conscious and I see myself as fat and ugly faced pig.,1
I’m not lazy!,0
Those who cannot stand to see others suffer.,0
They never give me a chance to explain something like a problem.,1
Has anybody else had a similar experience and how did you deal with it?,0
It’s been less than 24 hours and I’m still in shock.,0
"I want to have been born a girl, the real deal, not fucking surgery.",1
I’ve been under a lot of stress lately but I can’t excuse what I’ve done.,1
"Finally a year ago after my first suicide attempt I decided to seek help, I was 19 then.",1
"I'm not enjoying myself at all, so I don't want to do it anymore.",1
She said she too had a crush on me.,0
I keep waiting to wake up and realise this was all but a bad dream.,1
I can do this.,0
Hi.,0
I tired of the bullshit numb feeling that comes with it.,1
She couldn’t breath and was crying.,1
"I don’t know who to turn to anymore, to just sit down with someone and get everything off my chest.",1
To the outside world i seem fine because i put on a fake smile and just try to act like everything is fine.,1
I dont want to hurt him even more.,1
Anyone else feel like no one actually likes you and people just tolerate you.,1
"All my savings are gone with the surgery, and I don't know how I can make myself go to class anymore.",1
but i really regret putting this on them.,1
"The cancer is treatable but not curable 

I’m so shocked by all this.",1
Find people that feel the same way you do and help each other through.,1
I still feel really depressed at times and feel like I'm a 50 year old.,1
I guess I deserve this.,1
I don’t know who to talk to or what to do.,1
I’m literally battling with my demons every SINGLE day at least 12-16 hours a day.,1
"I have learned how to deal with feelings yet I dont know how to ""entertain"" myself.",1
I feel like I'm not very memorable.,1
3 am is for the writers who can’t sleep.,0

"I wish things were different

I wonder how much of a disappointment he now thinks I am",1
"i've been suffering with depression for a while, and i used to take acid pretty regularly.",1
I don’t enjoy anything anymore.,1
i don’t want to sound like one of those pretentious kids who think they were born in the wrong generation but i really do.,1
"If you knew a way to make yourself feel more happy, more fulfilled  and at more peace with yourself, would you DO IT ?",1
This lead me to have a lot of anxiety growing up because the moment I would get anything lower than an A in school I would go down a spiral of if I don't do well on this assignment then I will fail this class and if I fail this class I won't get to go to college and if I don't go to college I won't get a job and if I don't get a job I will be homeless and then I would probably die.,1
"I got a boyfriend for the first time, and he is genuinely a good guy.",0
The hope for being with less toxic people.,1
"After all, the person I used to love the most did just that.",0
"Everywhere I look around me, I can't help but notice how great everyone is.",0
If I can't take care of my mental health then I should still atleast spoil myself by having the right to have reactions and feelings in situations.,1
I realized this while doing some research on how I feel living life over the 2018 summer.,0
I pay for him to go out sometimes (I get payed well) but it embarrasses him.,0
I have a very small circle of people who I'm close with.,0
He just let it slide past and said “it’s in the past”.,0
"I don't know what I said  makes sense or not, I'm just beyond hurt at this point.",1
I (17) told her my life was more shitty than her's.,1
"and again , im just    *there.",0
Because at 3 am I can't sleep because you're the reason for my smile and the reason for my pain.,0
"I never had many friends, relationships and high school was a bit of a drag, as it is for most i'm sure..

&#x200B;

I took a year to myself then started at a tech school, it was going well... 3 semesters away from graduation, the school shut down ... the entire chain.",1
Nobody would miss me.,1
"I've always come to reddit when ever I've needed some advice on a topic, and recently I've been using Reddit for help/advice on how I'm feeling (the title).",1
Right now my aunt and cousins are over and they've only been over here since yesterday but they have sucked all my energy out.,1
"I dont deserve to be happy, i dont deserve to be with him.",1
And again.,0
"At least, I'm not fine.",1
Since they all try really hard and are always bragging about their accomplishments.,0
I came out when I was 19 and have depression and anxiety.,1
"And people stop contacting me when I don’t go to their birthdays, etc.",1
"Sadness, extreme bouts of sadness, that’s the only feeling.",1
I haven't done anything all day.,1
Now I really hit rock bottom again.,1
Maybe I'm wrong?,0
But it’s 1000x more painful cause he doesn’t  like me anymore and i still love him.,1
"I can’t even talk to my friends about my problems, they will never understand me.",1
"So I’ve never been clinically diagnosed with depression, so I’m not gonna tell you guys I have chronic depression .",1
Perhaps it was the dark effect upon my eyes that made the light so blaring and offensive.,1
I feel like I'm in quicksand and struggling just makes me sink faster.,1
if you are spending christmas alone just to know i love u and we can spend christmas talking together.,0
i feel like i am fucking useless.,1
I wish they didnt save me..,1
"Like today, I feel worthless.",1
"And it sent me back to when my mom told me I was an accident, and the times he told me I was an accident and basically was supposed to be given up for adoption.",1
"So as you can tell my life is pretty crap; and personally I find it pretty shitty and patronising tries to say that ""it gets better"" because the reason why I'm suicidal and depressed is for reasons I cannot control, I will probably never forget my past and I don't think that it's a good thing, so I will never technically ""get better"", I'm just gonna have to get used to it because nothing will ever change...",1
My cousin has issues.,0
I have to wait a few years to die because i would move houses so I wouldn’t know anybody.,1
I dont know.,0
"I saw you scrolling through 
You look kind of sad... 
Do you need a hug?",0
It’s like I constantly fret on a doomed outcome.,1
I’m starting to believe that I’m just the bad guy and that’s what I’ll always be.,1
"So I called the closest place that I live by, and they didn't pick up.",0
I got into a really bad accident which started it all off.,0
"I'm not in the position financially for things to ""get worse before they get better,"" I'm lucky to have free therapy though.",1
All my friends left me after that and my family started to get mad at me.,1
I hate it.,1
She said he had cancer and that it was going to get a lot worse so they decided to put him to sleep.,1
The nurse had no idea what to do and immediately ran for the doctor.,0
I don't know.,0
The fruits of life are bleak and bittersweet but my appetite is dull.,1
No one will care for the long run anyways if I’m not there.,1
It's usually not my only reason for disappearing; I just genuinely need a break from it all sometimes.,1
"you've been through a lot and for that I respect you a lot"" stay blessed stay strong 🌈",0
Let it be a deadly disease or any kind of accident that doesn't involve other people then I am all good.,1
"I don't need to know you name, age, location, gender, anything like that to do everything in my completely normal humanly power to remind you life is always worth living.",0
I hate my body as well which impacts my sex life and social life.,1
Sometimes I think about having a near death experience where I fully believe I’m going to die but I end up living.,1
"Then the real kicker was—he told me, “Oh you must have been really quiet.” This is something I have struggled with my whole life.",1
But I think this should go on my main account.,0
It’s to the point that I can’t bring myself to go to work about once a week.,1
I guess I’ll just start off with a preface.,0
No one even notices the cuts on my arms.,1
"Why do I have to get a job, when doing so causes a massive downward spiral in my mental health?",1
Eat better.,0
"WORK/CAREER

I am 30 years old, working in a shitty recruitment outsouring office I hate.",1
"My childhood, 3 family dogs that helped me emotionally, my birth mom, my birth siblings.",0
"By the end of it all, I feel pretty accomplished and good about myself.",0
No one has any fucking idea haha im suffering silently.,1
"the stupid notes in class and eye contact, mouthing words that she can’t understand because she sucks at reading lips.",1
When they are talking I just start to space out and think about other things and it makes me feel bad.,1
I can't even text her mom because she blocked my number.,1
Im too scared to ask my dad if he’s ok. I’m literally crying cause that made me so so sad.,1
"&#x200B;

I'm here to talk.",0
It's a five hour walk to anything.,0
Grown my hair even.,0
the highest highs aren't worth the slightest lows.,0
"Why am I here
Why does no one hear?",0
I finished my degree.,0
This will be the first year since I was in my early teens that I don't get to tell her happy birthday.,0
So who am I though?,0
"I used to think I could be a writer or a painter or something in fashion and that was my calling, but every attempt at those things I just get so frustrated because I suck at it.",1
I want to be numb again.,1
"I told one of my friends how I've been feeling and showed her my scars but all she said was ""oh of course you're telling me NOW.""",0
I want to get better but Jesus Christ people are just so rude nowadays.,1
"It’s like they’re happy to see me angry, or mentally unstable.",1
Like they know I’m like this but they don’t care!,0
Why does the universe hate me?,1
Why did I have to be like this?,0
"I never wanted to be unhappy, I just wish I could be like other people my age, going out with friends and doing other fun stuff.",1
I wish I could just be normal.,0
Is it that hard?,0
Why won’t society accept me?,0
My friends are asking my why I’m still sad over my ex when I have a girlfriend.,0
Glue can’t completely fix cracks my dear 💔,0
That if someone brings them up you you go into a depression ?,0
As weird and weak as it sounds i have them,0
"I'm 17,
high school dropout,
cant get employed,
no friends,
bad at literally everything i attempt, even the video games i spent thousands of hours on,
leeched off my parents and brother my whole life,
next year im gonna be homeless and i have no idea how to keep myself alive even within a home.",1
what do i do gents?,0
I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety.,1
"I have had these problems since I was a kid, but only got diagnosed a year ago as my mum doesn't believe in depression and would never take me to a doctor, and I was afraid to go by myself.",0
"Finally a year ago after my first suicide attempt I decided to seek help, I was 19 then.",1
It was around this time that I met my SO.,0
I have told him since the beginning about my depression and about a suicide attempt.,1
I thought he understood.,0
That was a year ago and to this day I cannot seem to explain to him.,0
"He thinks I'm over reacting, and that everyone feels that way sometimes.",0
Only I feel like that all the time.,0
2 months ago he broke up with me.,0
"I tried to kill myself again, failed again and decided to seek help, I took medication for 2 weeks, but I cannot afford to go back to the doctor.",1
He stills doesn't understand and I don't know how to explain to him and its killing me as no one else knows and I don't want to tell anyone.,1
Any help?,0
Being nice.,0
Being nice to people helps me feel better.,0
"I feel happy seeing others smile, and appreciated.",0
What’s everyone’s thing that helps them through the day?,0
"I had a pretty good day, I cleaned the apartment, had a successful date and got her number, but yet I still feel like shit.",1
Why?,0
I just want to be normal...,0
It's back again.,0
"I don't understand, I have a great job and I am out of jail.",0
(Spent 6 months in county jail) There are minor things I'm bummed about.,0
"For example, I am allowed to work but I gotta spend the nights in jail.",0
"No problem, I am making money and saving up.",0
My co workers are some of the coolest people I've worked with.,0
"My phone bill is a little high but no problem, in time i can pay it off.",0
"But for some reason, I feel empty and alone.",1
I would like to lay in my own bed and just chill.,0
I wish I had a girl I could cuddle with right now and listen to some music and talk.,0
Get everything off our chest.,0
Anyone else feel like this?,0
a while ago i met two friends who i genuinely felt a strong connection with.,0
"i could tell them everything, and they could tell me everything.",0
everytime i spend with them felt like true happiness.,0
i forgot my sadness and loneliness.,1
"but as time passes by, our lives become harder as we mature, and we slowly become apart from each other.",0
"this gets me so lonely, because i find that i am only truly myself around them.",1
"i have shared my darkest moments with them, and the fact that i dont see them anymore puts me in a state of loneliness.",1
i've come to the point that i have relied on them for happiness and clung to them to a point that i am empty without them.,1
"i am quite productive in my life for the reason that i force myself to do things i have to so that i can reach my goals, but i still feel empty and lonely.",1
"as i write this, i think about growing older and losing all my friends.",1
"what if i become completely lonely, and have no one?",1
i think that will be the point where i go truly insane.,0
I am sitting in a bar all alone in a new city.,0
I have no friends here and I have to spend 2 years with my bipolar dad here.,0
He never helped me through my education and he still thinks that I am a child.,0
So the story starts about a month ago.,0
My wife started to have feelings for a friend of ours in a social group we have.,0
Just started out with her sending adult pics to him.,0
she had confessed for this and ask for apology and we tried to work on that.,0
Sometime later she ended up having a drunken kiss with him which I found out about later.,0
So I confronted her 3 weeks ago when I found out how far they had gone and ask her do you still love me?,0
Do you want a divorce?,0
And there she had a complete breakdown.,0
"She couldn't handle what she had done, couldn't handle that we needed to work on us.",0
She packed up her stuff and left for his place.,1
"On her way out I gave her one thing to think about, ""if you sleep with him don't come home.""",0
So she doesn't come home that night.,0
She messages me in the morning and says I'm coming home to get my stuff.,0
I tried to talk with her to work things out.,0
She refuses to work on us at all.,1
with her mental break it seems like she's going through a manic episode.,1
She went from person to person asking for comfort and support for what she did.,0
Not even her best to friends of 15 years supported actions that she did.,0
Her parents were appalled at what she decided.,0
She can't seem to recognize the lives in the friendships she's ruined.,1
Two weeks ago she tried to have us do a counseling session.,0
"In the counseling session our first one, the counselor asked what we said on her intake paperwork.",0
I said I wanted to work on reconciliation.,0
and the first thing that came out of her mouth was I want a separate.,1
"Not I want to try to fix us, fix our problems with our help.",1
But to get out of here.,0
She was the woman who you may know that would skip from guy to guy when a relationship got too rough for them.,1
When they didn't know how to express themselves to work on their marriage.,0
And this is what she did.,0
We were married only one and a half years before she bailed.,1
Just like her previous relationships.,0
"I've been sitting at home for almost a month now trying to figure out what I could have done what could have been different, what should she have done.",1
But nothing is helping.,1
I can't help someone who refuses to help themselves.,0
"I love this woman with all of my heart, Body, Soul.",0
And what she has done to me has been the worst thing I've ever experienced in my life.,1
"Trying to find something to hold me together, to make the days pass, without trying to just either want to make it end, or just find a way to make the pain stop.",1
I'm constantly checking her Facebook to see if she has any new post.,0
"Obsessing over something of hers, all of our memories in the house we built.",1
I don't know what to do.,0
I'm lost.,1
"I have people to talk to, I have people who will listen to my story.",0
"I even have people who agree with everything I've done, saying you've done nothing wrong, she's not willing to work on you on your marriage.",1
"Ans so I sit at home, alone where the last 4 years of my life I spent with the woman who I thought I was going to die with.",1
The woman who I thought was going to be the end-all-be-all in my life and in hers.,0
Now she's run off with someone 20 years older than her so that she can get her jollies off and adventure in her life.,0
I f****** hate her I f****** hate what she did to me.,1
"I f****** hate the lives she's ruined, not just mine, but of the friends that we shared.",1
"The only ones that even know our close friends that we shared together, and our families.",0
No one outside of that mutual family knows anything.,0
"I want to scream out online that she cheated on me, that nobody should back her.",1
"that I wasn't the one that shoved her away, that I wasn't the one that made her not come home.",1
I gave her every opportunity to try to help us bring us back together.,0
Yes I had my faults.,1
And I worked my damndest at fixing those before she left.,0
But I wasn't enough for her she said.,1
I couldn't keep up with her she said.,0
I wasn't intellectually smart as she said.,0
I didn't give her enough variety.,1
I didn't give her what she needed.,1
I just don't know what to do.,1
I've not been alone like this in so long.,1
Crying every night before I go to bed.,1
Trying to just go to sleep and not have the voices in my head screaming at me.,1
Trying not to think of what she's doing right now with another guy.,1
It tortures me to no end.,1
I feel like life is weighing me down and I’m trying to swim up for air.,1
Holding onto....,0
I don’t know what there is to left to hold intoxicating But should I just let go?,0
It's a weird feeling.,0
"Everything is going well, life is good and I'm having fun.",0
"Yet, I'm depressed at the same time.",1
"I find myself laughing less, and less sociable.",1
"I guess some people would just call it ""depression"", but I've never been so distinctly happy at the same time.",0
"So I doubt anyone will actually read this, I mean we are all here because we have our own battles, so how can we be expected to help someone else.",0
"That being said I literally have no one (not one person) in my life to talk to about this, so i turn to the anonymity of the internet and Reddit as my outlet.",1
This has been a really hard year.,0
Like really hard.,0
"I wont bore everyone with the details, but with Christmas Eve being tomorrow, I was trying to remember the last time I was happy.",1
"Not like huge event deliriously happy, but just happy about anything.",0
"Honestly, I couldn't remember when it was.",0
"It got me thinking, and I want to preface this, I am NOT at all suicidal.",0
"But has anyone else every though life is hard, i am tired and just ready for it to be over.",1
"Again I am reiterating I am not going to hurt myself, its just, I'm tired of life being so hard.",1
"Its like, you can go to an amusement park and have so much fun all day, but at a certain point, not matter how much fun it was, you are ready to go home.",1
"I am 33, and that's how I feel about life.",0
Like I am just ready to leave so it can be easy.,1
Has anyone else every thought or felt like this?,0
Everything I do is just a distraction.,0
"I'm essentially limited to three emotions now too: anxiety, anger, and sadness.",1
"If I'm not feeling those, I feel nothing.",0
"It makes me feel (ha) like a liar for saying I'm depressed because I can still function, but beyond doing what is absolutely necessary, I don't do anything at all.",1
I just..do nothing.,0
But even doing things that I 'like' it's as if I don't even like them anymore.,1
"I absolutely love the LotR movies, and I tried to watch one the other day and I just..couldn't.",1
I turned it off and stared at a wall for awhile.,1
Today is a good example of what I mean.,0
It was full of distractions.,1
"I was busy and had no time to think at all about anything other than what I was doing, and when I finally had a moment, my whole day came crashing.",1
"First, I felt anxious about not being 'depressed enough', and then stopped thinking about it because I ***do not*** want to think myself into a depressive state.",1
"Then, I thought about my day in general and realized that I didn't care about any of what I had done.",1
Schoolwork?,0
Check.,0
Christmas bullshit for family?,0
Check.,0
"Housework, pet's needs, even a workout so I don't get fat (because even when I do something good for myself, my motivation is anxiety and self hatred).",1
"But that's all I did, was check it off the list of Things Functioning People do.",0
"I don't even know if I'm depressed right now, it's just how I've always been hence the title.",1
"Every few months I'm the poster child for depression, but months like these are worse because I don't feel like a good person, I barely feel like a person at all.",1
I attempted suicide (a long time ago; I'm fine now in that respect) during an episode like this once.,1
My life is bullshit.,1
I just want you guys to know I love you all.,0
For the past couple years I've been in a downward spiral of depression.,1
I got into a really bad accident which started it all off.,0
Failed the first quarter of my nursing program which took over a year to get into then was placed at the bottom of the list again.,1
This made me go even deeper into my depression.,1
This past year was filled with feelings of not wanting to exist.,1
Contemplating the benefits my non-existence would have on others.,1
Distancing myself from my amazing friends and family and most of all my husband.,1
Causing extreme social anxiety for myself and feeling like a moron when speaking to others due to my isolation.,1
"Laying in bed, hiding from the world in the darkness of my covers.",1
Starving because I just couldn't leave the safe haven of my bedroom.,1
"Feeling disgusting because I just couldn't muster up the energy to shower, brush my hair and teeth.",1
"Feeling like total shit and a waste of space because while I was wallowing in self pity, my amazing husband would go work his ass off to support us.",1
I just want to tell you all that I love you.,0
Today has been a really good day.,0
I slept like shit and woke up at 4 am after 4 hours of sleep and haven't taken a nap that would last late into the evening.,1
I'm actually at the kitchen table.,0
I'm here typing away while I listen to music and crying like a baby.,1
"God, I can't describe to you how much I love music and how stupid I am for pushing something I love so much out of my life.",1
I haven't sat down and actually listened to music in so long and it just makes me so happy that I'm crying.,0
I just feel so lucky in this moment.,0
I hope it lasts.,0
I hope I can hold on to this feeling and lock it up tight.,0
I just love you guys so much and I wish I could share this with you.,0
I wish I could spread this to you.,0
"Please, know you're not alone.",0
"Please, know that I will listen.",0
"Please, know that I love you.",0
Thanks for letting share my feelings.,0
I'm so scared it won't last but I just want you guys to know there is something there.,1
"Don't give up, ok.",0
I'm just wondering if I'm alone in this.,0

"appearances can be deceiving is a term that youve heard

and if I wondered it’d be absurd, to think of where you went

or what you said when we had that argument,

I saw your face and didn’t know what to say,

except that I never felt so indifferent that day,

I failed to play the game in the right way,

and if I went back I still wouldn’t have asked you to stay,

because I can’t have you back when all you do is cry

and if I kept asking why, you’d know it’s a lie

to say that I care, to say it isn’t fair, and what is fair?",1
is life fair?,0
does your mind wander?,0
does it go blank?,0
and do you bare?,0
"and it’s close to the time when we dress up and scare

and I dont wear mask, because you say I just stare,

so I am my own slasher, and Ill take up the screen

in the movie you call your life, ill be all that is seen

and youll know where Ive been, if you sit and watch the silver glean

the lights of the projector are not what they seem,

and if i died i’d haunt you in the middle of your dream,

and if you could see me now, you would be in the scene

and if we cut the camera and we could make life clean

we’d all have a love story instead of splitting at the seem

and that’s the life we all live, and the the saddness I’ve seen

and if I could cry a thousand tears, it wouldn’t make all the years

that I spent having fears, worth all the pain of those sneers,

i still love you the same, but know im somewhat to blame

that the relation is done, and all that life has begun

im sad for what was said, and I wish it was done.",1
"and I’ll never say that I didn’t have fun,

but that’s life on earth and under the sun.",0
"its been a long time since ive written down my thoughts,

i’d say I missed it, but lets connect the dots

im sitting and im watching the people that are gawking

they look back at me, and I to them,

they see what they see, and its them who condemn

the thoughts that I speak, or the thoughts that I think

and if I told you, or told a shrink, id be crazy

so don’t even think, Im ready to fight and ive got the guts,

because ive grown, i grew big nuts

ill stand on the highest tower, and look down to the street

and ill see all those who judge, and all who stare at their feet

if you loved, or if you hated, it doesn’t matter

all our lives are slated, roll the camera, say the lines

stick to the script, and see the signs,

your life is ending and thought defines,

there is a woman, who stands and shines,

 the one for you, and your lifes designes.",0
"because being happy is hard sometimes

because we’re human, were misunderstood,

who will find me?",0

While i was in vacation i get a text from my girlfriend...you already know where this is going ...it was a 2 years relationship when i was with her i was happy and she helped me a lot with my mental issues i cry every night i dont want to hurt myself ...i just miss her so much i want to die ...really i want to disappear ...even for a minute 

I want her back...",1
"I need her back... 



And im french so if its not good or anything im sorry i want you to have a perfect day ...do it for me ...be happy today ...please",0
I just sat in the dark and sobbed my eyes out.,1
I feel so empty.,1
And drained of life.,1
I don’t know how to be a person anymore.,1
"I’m so sick of trying to change things, only to end up at the same place: where everything is hopeless.",1
I don’t have the strength to keep picking myself up and glueing myself back together.,1
I hate everything about myself.,1
"From the way my brain works, from the way I process things, from the way I sound, from the way I look, from the way I act.",0
"I hate that I’ll never be who I wish I could be, because there’s something deeply flawed about me and that will never change.",1
I don’t belong in this universe.,1
I had to put my dog down today.,0
I miss him so much.,0
I have to go to college very soon and it was so hard last year and I am barely passing into this year of college.,1
The pressure is so bad to succeed but I just get so sad half way through the year and everything goes wrong.,1
Now with my dog gone I’m gonna start this year depressed.,1
I don’t know how I’m gonna do it.,0
I was struggling last year and nothing was wrong but now it just feels impossible.,1
I want to learn but I just get so down and I don’t want to do anything.,1
"I just feel like everyone hates me and doesn’t want me around and now my dog, one of the only two things in my life that I can trust is gone.",1
I don’t know how I’ll find the energy to do anything.,1
"It scares me just to post

I don’t know what anyone could say as a reply and I will probably be buried under other posts but fuck it, I needed to say something.",1
I don't know what to do anymore.,1
I can't sleep at night.,1
My thoughts keep me up.,1
Nothing helps.,0
So I got a part time job working max 30 hours or less each week.,0
But the other day family got after me saying how why don't I work full time at 49 hours to see how hard and tiresome it is.,0
Since my family works 40 hours each week and are tired after.,0
They think me not doing their shifts isn't right since I'm 32 and their 60's.,0
I wouldn't mind working 40 hours.,0
"And another thing is my family tends to compare me to other family members, like my cousin who's around my age, shes married, has her own place, job, etc.",0
Family says why aren't I doing that too.,0
"It's like I'm working and living at home with you guys but they say well your living here for free, you don't know how to pay the bills like your cousin does etc.",0
"I pay my own cell phone bill, cable TV bill and was paying rent but family stopped that.",0
"It's like I don't get it, they are proud of me working and yet aren't so WTF.",0
I've dealt with depression and anxiety for a while so not sure what to do.,1
I hate my family like so freaking much they are horrible and are the reason I have no confidence or self esteem.,1
"My sisters constantly bully me, criticise me, or are just horrible to me in general and my mum laughs it off but ass soon as o retaliate she acts like I’ve killed someone.",1
It’s horrible.,0
I’ve got nobody to talk to and my only outlet is cutting myself.,1
I cry myself to sleep every night.,1
I don’t think anyone even remotely understand how much my sisters constant bullying is effecting me.,1
Everyone loves my sisters.,0
They are the pretty and confident girls who are smart and do well in school.,0
"They are mean to me in front of my other family members and in public but people just laugh it off, thinking it’s just some fun.",1
It’s not just some fun.ive been going through this my whole life.,0
The only perk is I’m good at hiding my feelings.,0
I’m good at bottling things up.,0
I’m good at lying as if I tell my mum anything she’ll get angry at me.,0
But I also have trust issues.,0
I can’t let anyone to close to me otherwise they’ll ruin my life.,1
They will take everything I’ve told them and use it against me.,0
Blackmail me.,0
Tell everyone.,0
"If my own sisters do it to me, why wouldn’t anyone else?",0
They are the reason I can’t talk to anyone.,1
The reason I have social anxiety.,1
"The reason why, anytime I’m in an argument with anyone, I can’t say anything or I want to start crying because it brings back bad memories.",1
I have this wall built up and I hate it.,0
But it’s the only way to protect myself.,0
I feel worthless.,1
Like I don’t amount to anything.,1
Like I’m hideous.,1
Like I’m a freak.,1
Like I have a disgusting body.,1
If my own family don’t like me why would anyone else?,0
The though of killing myself is always on my mind.,1
I need help but don’t know how to get it.,0
This is just a personal rant I needed to let out.,0
If you read this I am genuinely sorry for wasting your time with something silly like this.,0
Life's been good recently and I like to log it all down so when I feel bad I can look back at the positives.,0
Can I keep just posting random stuff that feels like an achievement?,0
"I feel like I'm just looking for approval and am not sure if it helps others or just me...I don't wanna be like ""Hey I'm doing all this stuff and you're doing nothing"" coz I've been there and I'll be back there, I don't have any bad intent though.",0
Just looking for the positives in a negative world.,0
"Anyway I started unicycling again the past few weeks, just up and down the road at night clinging to the wall lol.",0
"Someone was putting their rubbish out tonight and said ""Wow that looks good keep it up!"".",0
It made my day.,0
I'm thinking of going to and from the pharmacy (I have a daily script to pickup) with it if I can get good enough.,0
Then maybe take some other circus stuff and start a club in my area (there isn't one right now).,0
Maybe I could even film some of it and put it on youtube!,0
That'd be nice.,0
Did anyone else have anything that made them feel good recently?,0
"(or any time really)

edit: thanks for the replies and encouragement guys, also thanks undercurrents for clarifying the rules to me",0
I told him basically everything that describes anhedonia.,0
also how I been get out of depression cuz nothing please me no more I also told him about my OCD problems so they gave me Zoloft.,1
My question How is everybody's experience in Zoloft and is there any bad side effects I should watch out for?,0
I just want to be happy again.,1
I (23F) broke up with my boyfriend (26M) of 5 years a couple of months ago.,0
At first I was so depressed.,1
Couldn’t eat or sleep.,1
Lost 15 pounds from not eating.,1
I got better with therapy (it really does help).,0
I was finally proud of the growth I was making.,0
"In the past week or so, I have been missing him so much and haven’t had the will to get out of bed some days.",1
It’s my birthday as of 45 minutes ago and I realize it’s because this is my first birthday alone.,1
"Before we moved out, I lived with my parents who always made me feel special on my birthday.",0
Then I lived with him for 5 years and he made me feel special on this day.,0
One year he couldn’t afford to get me a gift so he hand picked flowers around the neighborhood.,0
I feel so alone on a day I usually feel so happy.,1
I feel so pathetic for not being able to make myself happy.,1
I feel dumb for even admitting this because I know so many more people out there have way bigger problems than not feeling special on their birthday.,0
Idk I guess I just wanted to vent.,0
"Hey guys

I need help guys I don't feel anything but self hate now no matter what I do.",0
I can be doing something fun but I always feel like I'm doing something wrong and I sick of puttimg my mask on everyday and hiding my pain.,1
"As for me,
I have 884 messages( not emails) that I need to read, acknowledge or reply, which I am avoiding.",0
"Looking for answers of this sort, funny answers, self deprecating ones are most welcome, any answer is fine.",0
Just to humour ourselves,0
I'm not depressed I'm just mentally unstable and close to breaking like a long stick being bent,1
"Am I the only person that has been their only source of happiness, and whenever you get tired they just can't handle themselves anymore and just want to cry, but the blank expression on their face doesn't move and you just slowly keep losing themselves and those connections to others around you?",0
countless people have said im annoying and not give a reason why.,0
"i just got banned from replying to moderators messages after i got tempbanned from r/freespeech from saying “cereal is just crunchy soup” 2 months ago, then i replied “but cereal *is* just crunchy soup” to the message.",0
my brother constantly starts aguements with me for no reason.,0
"my mom gets me in trouble for things my brother did, all of my other family just ignores me.",0
i just want to be loved for once.,1
i havent had a hug in months.,0
I was diagnosed with depression at the age of 8 due to some health issues.,1
Once I was old enough and lost my health insurance I was unable to get my medicine.,0
It's been six years I've done drugs and had an alcohol problem.,0
I overcame those temporary fixes and got myself back to trying get my hse.,0
Yesterday I hit rock bottom and ruined everything I had.,1
No one believes I have depression because I'm happy on the outside.,1
"I miss my wife, it is my fault she left.",0
She was the only thing keeping my head up.,0
I've been cigarette free for a month thanks to her support.,0
I'm back to smoking and feel it is all down hill from here.,1
One moment I feel like I'm on top of the world and things are getting better and then reality comes back to crush all of that positivity and hope into dust.,1
I keep trying and scrambling to pull myself out of this pit but as soon as I'm almost out I get slammed into it again.,0
"Every day is like a repeating nightmare of waking up miserable, fighting to be happy, the pain and sorrow tearing me apart all over again, then trying so hard to sleep but never being able to because I can't stop thinking or feeling so many negative emotions at the same time.",1
I'm so tired of feeling like such a god damn loser all the time.,1
"If this is what life is, I don't want it.",1
Honestly I've never felt validated by anyone.,0
"Not my mother, father, siblings, any of my family and now I just feel like I'm done with everything.",1
"I just want to let go, say goodbye and die and believe me I know it sounds dramatic but I literally have nothing and no one.",1
I am nothing.,1
No one would notice if I were to never come home again.,0
They would probably be relieved.,0
I really want to die.,1
I don't see a point to living anymore,1
I am done trying to be happy.,1
I’ve tried so hard for so long and it just won’t happen.,1
There's this girl I'm friends with and she has a boyfriend and I can't stop thinking about her.,0
I want it to stop.,0
"I wish I never met her, but at the same time I just want to atleast talk to and see her more often.",0
I haven't in over two weeks.,0
"I text her sometimes, but I just want to see her or have longer conversations through text, but I don't even know what to say.",0
"I want to tell her I love her, but I think she already knows.",0
I want to say it anyways.,0
I want all of it to fucking dissappear.,0
And then it's like even if somehow at some point I ended up with her would I actually be happy.,0
I never feel happy so how would that change anything.,1
I want to gouge out my emotions from my brain and hate everyone and never see them again.,1
How do I make it all stop?,0
Please fucking somebody actually help me.,0
People try but how am I supposed to get rid of the thoughts?,0
How can I just move on?,0
I feel like I'm physically falling apart.,1
i’ll try to make this quick.,0
i have self harm scars on my leg that won’t go away and i have to wear a short dress in about a month and i don’t know how to cover them.,1
if anybody knows anything that would fade them or cover them up that would be greatly appreciated.,0
I'm 31 and this has been you gnon for a few years now but is getting so bad i do t leace the house u less I am going to work because there is nothing to do.,1
I'm so over it I just want to be normal and having fun again.,0
"Hey I'm new to this sub, but I just want to say I am here to talk to anyone pretty much any time, I always have my phone on me and if you are in dire need of someone to listen I am here and I will do my best to help you.",0
I am 18 and I just barely crawled out of depression months ago (my ex helped me when we were dating).,1
"It started when I was 14 and when my parents took practically my only friend away from me and from this I became lonely, depressed, and I didn't want to be alive anymore.",1
"But as the years went by, I proved my parents wrong and I became a stronger person from my experiences and I know how much depression sucks and what it does.",0
I used to love running and being fit but I stopped right when I got depressed.,1
"I have my own goals I'm still working towards and I just want to say, that's one thing that helps.",0
Setting your own goals for things you want to do and making a list is honestly something that helps so much when it comes to depression.,0
Feel free to send me a message anytime though and I will do my best to help!,0
"I'm not certified or anything, but I wish to be better to this world, even though it hasn't treated me as good.",0
And the start could be helping you.,0
"All of my misery, pain, and heartache is my own fault.",0
I refused to get help for my issues and hurt the person I love emotionally very badly.,1
It's been more than 5 months since it all happened but the guilt and regret still gnaw at me.,1
She loved me more than anyone and I took her for granted and thought she would always be there no matter how bad I got.,0
That obviously wasn't true and I'm glad it wasn't because she did not deserve to be treated badly.,0
"Me and her are friends now, and she's the most amazing friend I could ask for and we've been there for each other recently through some tough things.",0
Today she told me she always wishes we would have met at a different time and place and that there would always be a special place in her heart for me.,0
I wish we would have too.,0
I wish I would have gotten help before I got so volatile.,1
I wish I wouldn't have taken her for granted.,0
I wish I could tell her I love her.,0
This is the most pain I've ever been in and I don't know how to handle it.,1
Everything is my fault.,0
I basically broke my own fucking heart by being a broken asshole.,1
I hate myself so fucking bad.,1
It's hard to live with the fact that I hurt the woman I thought I would be with forever and it hurts even more to still love her as much as I did a year ago when things were good while she's drifted apart.,1
I wish I had a time machine.,0
Finally think something is going your way and you'll be happy only to have it ripped away the moment you get comfortable.,0
I feel like I'm going insane.,0
It's hard to deal with this shit.,1
Why can't I just be happy?,0
Everytime something good happens ten more shitty horrible things happen on top of the good thing disappearing as if it never existed in the first place.,1
I'm at my wits end.,0
I just want it all to be over.,1
"I don't know how to explain this but I'm at a road block and I don't know what to in general, I stay up late every night, overthinking and just overall really miserable.",1
I don't get any like achievement or satisfaction out of anything and i'm usually just sad,1
"Im a smartass, im unfunny, if people get close i tend to eventually just dismiss them as I am scared of them leaving me.",1
I'm narcissistic.,0
I don't even fucking talk half of the time.,1
I'm awkward as all hell.,0
I don't even like myself.,1
I make wrong comments.,0
I tend to not even help people if is ee them in unstable as I feel like I'll only make it worse.,0
I'm not even a likeable person.,1
I just want to get this out there so I finally have said it.,0
Hopefully this helps me to get these things fixed .,0
Hitting this post button is hard.,0
I hope no one sees that I know sees this.,0
Right now I'm supposed to be in class.,0
But I don't care.,0
I get a bad grade on a test.,1
And I shrug it off.,0
I KNOW I'm supposed to be freaking out about it but I don't know why I just.,0
Don't care.,0
I look forward to nothing in the future.,1
I have no actual friends.,1
"And the only people that I show my ""true self"" of me just dying inside.",1
They just leave.,0
And there are so many people I don't want to leave.,0
But they don't care about me.,0
They have their own lives.,0
And I just sit at home.,0
I don't care about anything.,1
I'd give everything.,0
Just to love something.,0
Or someone.,0
Or anything.,0
But I dont.,0
I cant get up anymore and I dont knoe why I bother anymore..,1
Although Birdsong is usually male birds full of testosterone trying to get laid,0
I can’t ever see myself being truly happy after the last year and a half.,1
"I’ve lost a family member, my dog (who had been my life companion), I was allowing myself to be treated like shit by someone who I thought I was going to marry while he went around finding someone else to date.",1
"I’ve been on dates with new people, but all of them ended up choosing someone else.",0
My mental health is worse than it’s been in my entire life.,1
"I’m always paranoid and on edge, I don’t like being with people but I get depressed when I’m alone.",1
I have some friends but none that I feel like I can really depend on.,0
"I’m so worried about my parents and their health, because I’m an only child and I’m afraid I’m going to end up alone in the world.",1
Everything just feels so hopeless and it feels like something I won’t be able to recover from.,1
It’s like all my resilience has been killed.,0
I have no motivation to even try anymore.,1
"The world just seems like such a hopeless place, and people go through far worse things than what I described and there seems to be no fairness to it at all.",1
"If he doesn’t love me then I’m not really sure why I’m here, because that means that nearly everything good in my life, except my son, was a lie.",0
I don’t want to believe it to be true but I don’t think it’s logical to see it any other way.,0
We were at a party together tonight and he was incredibly hurtful.,0
I left and got an uber home.,0
I was gone over two hours and he didn’t even notice.,0
Now he’s home but ignoring me because he’s mad.,0
While I was alone I had a dream that I had explained  everything to someone and they asked if I thought he loved me.,0
"I said no, how could I?",0
Given how he is with me.,0
"They said good, because now I can see that.",0
"I don’t know if it’s because I’m depressed I’m thinking this way, or if I’m depressed because my subconscious knows the truth I couldn’t face.",1
"I’m so confused because I felt like he did love me, but perhaps I was mistaken",0
I generally just don’t want to be alive anymore but I don’t want to die or kill myself and cause my friends and family that stress but I wish I could just A Wonderful Life myself and not ever have existed.,1
I am just really tired of life being a fight.,1
I don’t really have anymore fight in me and am on my last leg.,1
I think I’m probably depressed but I’ve never been to the doctors or anything.,0
I can’t help but feel like such dead weight to my friends and family.,1
I feel like even at my most depressed I never felt this alone.,1
I’m so depressed I don’t even want to move.,1
I tried to tell my parents on NYE how I've been feeling for the better part of last year.,0
"Basically I've been getting in really low moods, crying myself to sleep, over thinking everything and putting my eating and sleeping patterns out of wack.",1
"Anyway, I was drinking with the family on NYE and I get honest when I drink, so I told them how I was feeling.",0
I guess I should of tried to tell them before I started drinking but I don't think I'd be able to.,0
"I told them I wanted to see someone about how I have been feeling, so that I could try and help myself.",0
Here's a few things my parents replied with.,0
"""How can you be depressed when you have a loving family, friends, a job and a boyfriend?",0
You're too young to be stressing about anything.,0
Do you feel like you don't get enough attention?,0
Is that why you make up these stupid things about yourself?,0
You only feel like this now because you're drinking.,0
"You're fine, stop being a baby...""

So yeah, Happy New Year everyone x",0
it’s just so easy to not care.,0
"i know how to feel, i know what’s normal for me.",0
I have these fantasies that I go to bed with every night.,0
"Every night I imagine jumping off a building, a swan-dive almost, and then a noose comes around my neck and I jolt.",1
My body hangs limply like a doll.,0
It is the only time I feel peace.,0
Um because i have a chemical imbalance in my brain?!,0
I just feel more alienated and misunderstood when people say this to me.,0
"People need to stop inappropriately calling being sad "" depression"".",0
"imagine being happy and not lonely

fuck how good would it be

help me",0
"I think Im starting to realize that I dont neccesarily hate uni so far and am too depressed to do things, but Im just used to coming home everyday and having minimum of 3 hours alone to do whatever i want.",1
"Now I have, basically nothing with roommates and I feel like theyre always judging me for constantly being in the room instead of going out.",1
I just... hope things get better.,0
I feel really alone and there is nowhere to go :( Im gonna start crying.,1
"man, i just want some friends",0
"My whole life I have been a gamer, N64, PS2, Xbox 360, PC.",0
"I played MMO, FPS, MOBA, Puzzle Platformers, Fighting Games, ect.",0
"Now its such a struggle for me to find joy in any game, I can download an emulator for free and practically play any game if I want to...",1
"Typically I'll just sit at the PC, stare at some ROMs/ISOs from my past and download them then I load and play for 5 minutes and just close the emulator.",1
"Or I'll spend 30 minutes browsing Steam store looking for something and never find anything I want to play, then I'll browse games I own on steam install them and never touch them.",1
"Hours go by and I do nothing, I rather just browse reddit and the internet endlessly, I'll refresh the same page over and over or I'll check a sub and find nothing new then 10 minutes later cycle through all the subs and end up back at the original sub.",0
"I own 250 games on steam, I own a PS4, its not that I don't have games.",0
"I have netflix, I dont watch any shows, I have cable and don't give a shit about anything on it.",1
"I have all sorts of material things, I have a car, phone, bed, bass+amp, headphones, fight stick, numerous controllers, laptop, web cam, gaming pc, ps4, n64 and tons of music.",0
"I cant find anything to do or enjoy anymore, every day I just want to eat, sleep, fast forward.",1
"isn't it just so funny how no-one cares unless a person is dead, somehow someones death makes them mean so much to someone when before they never cared.",0
"Recently a few people that i know of have died and now all i seem to see is posts about how they will be missed and how much they were loved, but yet no-one gave a shit about them before they were dead.",0
I'd like to share something with everyone that has made a world of difference for me.,0
"Please pardon if you've seen my post in another thread, I've posted this as much as I could.",0
This is for those days that aren't impossible btw.,0
Fake it to create it.,0
Fake being happy and joyful over something.,1
It's as simple as that.,0
It feels cheap when I do it as if I'm lying to myself but I do it anyways.,0
I do it with the intention the feeling of joy is the key to suppressing depression and fixing the way I see and feel.,1
And it is.,0
We have a tendency to expect joy to come to us when it's justified.,0
That won't happen when living with depression.,1
Things that should make you joyful won't.,0
It will never come.,0
Use joy like a tool.,0
Be wise about the situation and fake being joyful over things for the sake of fixing the way you see and feel.,0
It takes a few times of doing it over and over before it catches on but it always does (unless it's a completely impossible day which I hardly have anymore).,0
This might be hard to grasp the concept of but just try it.,0
Use energy and excitement to create the feeling of joy.,0
You can be joyful over nothing if you want to by just creating the feeling.,0
About a year ago my depression was terrible.,1
And I had it for years before that.,0
It was life stopping.,0
It completely consumed me.,0
My world was completely different.,0
Depression creates a lying world that seems so true and real.,1
The way I see and feel now is completely different.,0
The depression wouldn't let me be joyful about anything so I broke the rules.,1
"Through my 28 years of life, I've never fallen as low as what I am currently.",1
"I don't really know what to do, how to get help, who I can talk to.",1
"I'm not suicidal, I'm just extremely down/sad/depressed.",1
yeah im there,0
"I think I might be, but I have no idea.",0
"I should be happy, but I'm just... Idk...",0
It sucks.,0
Stuff no longer interests me.,1
"My art, music, video games, TV shows, etc.",0
no longer seem interesting or fun and I end up spending hours at a time just sitting in my chair mindlessly scrolling through Reddit...,1
"I can have fun sometimes though, but only if I'm high or drunkm I hate being alone with my own thoughts.",0
"Also, as a *fun* bonus, I'm pretty sure I have social anxiety.",1
"I don't ever go out, I hate small talk because it all feels so fake.",1
Who gives a fuck about the weather?,0
Who gives a fuck about where I'm from?,0
Everyone is going to judge me for it anyways.,0
"My emotions feel faked, except when it's anger and sadness.",0
"I don't really get excited about anything, and I can never express things outwardly.",1
"I bottle everything up and I don't know why...

Anyways, rant over.",0
Sorry if you had to read all of that.,0
I don't know the person behind this name.,0
This person I do not like.,0
"She is selfish, she is rude, she is a bother, her laugh is annoying, she is depressed, she has panic attacks.",1
This is not the person I want to be.,0
I want to be happy.,0
I want to feel a purpose in my soul.,0
I can't tell you where I belong.,0
"When I observe people as they smile or laugh, I wish I could feel the same warmth and joy they feel.",0
"As I watch videos of friends and people having a good time, I wonder if that will ever be me.",0
This person I am is not who I am.,0
I wish I knew who I was.,0
I feel like I'm just a below average dude in every aspect going through life on autopilot.,1
"I don't see any point in trying my best, yet I just do the minimum to not disappoint others.",1
Why?,0
As a teenager I wasnt a very good student.,0
"After taking a couple years off after high school, something finally clicked in my brain that gave me goals and made me want to be a contributing  member of society.",0
"I picked a degree field I was passionate about, got married, was getting good grades.",0
I was so proud of myself.,0
Then we lost our house in a flood.,0
"But I stayed in school, and kept my job.",0
"I never stopped because it was crunch time, time for me to prove how strong I am!",0
That wasn't a good idea.,0
It's been over 6 months since the flood and I still cry myself asleep every night.,1
"I've been to one class in the past 2 and a half weeks, I slept through a meeting at work and now I'm suspended for the week, my grades are dropping, I can feel myself trying to recluse up in my shitty apartment all day.",1
"I've made an appointment with a councelor for this week, but how do some of you guys take back control after your life turns into a slow motion car crash that you watch yourself cause as you simultaneously lose the power to fix it?",0
The worse things get the more I just feel paralyzed and cry.,1
I feel like I'm letting myself down.,1
Went to work today.,0
Still not feeling the best.,0
But a lot better then yesterday...,0
I've staved off suicide for the past... about 10 years through continuous logical debate/argument internally.,1
"Some days, the argument lasts only the first few minutes after waking; others, it's still raging when I fall asleep.",1
"In every case, I've pushed the line forward, or at least held it fast until reinforcements arrived.",0
"But, my troops are depleting.",0
"They are hungry, their weapons jamming or just running out of ammunition.",0
"They are dirty, tired, and their resolve is faltering from watching their comrades falling next to them, over and over.",0
"The line is weakening, and I'm starting to think they are getting cut off.",0
My internal logical arguer has begun developing a stutter.,0
His arguments are becoming... hollow and stale.,0
"The other side seems to have research, data, and eyewitness accounts on its side now; my arguer is dropping and misplacing his.",0
"I'm burning out, and I'm... concerned.",0
"It's becoming attractive in its simplicity, and I'm tired of being placed on hold, rushed ""to get to the point"", and run through a checklist by the crisis lines (I've called multiple over the past two months, when I first noticed the stutter).",0
My support network is in shambles.,0
"A victim of attrition, I suppose, as a full time college student.",0
The majority of my social network graduated and went to grad school; I stayed an extra year for a dual degree.,0
"My only real support is a micromanager and her quiet husband, who (quite reasonably) must prioritize their children and their own struggle, my ex, who left me and got engaged with her prior ex within 4 days of leaving me, and a friend half the country away.",0
I'm tired of being the superhero I am.,0
Not-Good-Enough Man.,0
"I'm tired of being kind, polite, caring, and courteous.",0
"Empathetic and sympathetic, open and honest, a listener and a shoulder.",0
"It has made be open to drugging and ""experimenting"", having my home invaded while on vacation ""because I wouldn't mind"", and being told I'm ""perfect, the ideal boyfriend"" when getting dumped.",0
I don't even know why I've bothered posting.,0
I deleted before submitting the last two times.,0
"I'm ready to give up proper, I just don't know how.",0
"Like, I'll finally get to the place where I can post something I think is mildly funny on a sub, and everyone is just a dick in response.",0
It's frustrating and hard to remember that these people don't actually know me.,0
"Sometimes it feels like a community, and other times it just sets me off, spiraling deeper into my own darkness.",0
I feel like an idiot.,0
Why do people get off on being rude?,0
"Sarcastic, ok.",0
"But flat out arrogant assholes really throw me, and I instantly get thrown back in to my own depression.",1
Anyway.,0
Stay strong guys.,0

In my experience at least.,0
"I've never really posted on reddit, mostly lurked.",0
Just feeling quite sad today.,0
"A few months ago my truck broke down, unable to get to work on time (23+ miles is hard to walk everyday on time) I ended up getting fired.",0
"I'm getting by, mostly by selling everything I have and donating plasma 2x a week.",0
"I decided to walk to the store today to make myself a cake for my birthday, for some reason I assumed I had eggs at home, sadly I did not.",0
And my neighbor's weren't so kind to lend me a few.,0
"I've been sitting at home, crying every now and then, staring at the phone hoping someone remembers.",1
"I called both of my parents, hinted at it, and got nothing from it.",0
I did the same with my 3 brothers.,0
"I just wanted someone to talk to, or wish me a happy birthday, or for one of my friends to take me out for pizza.",0
Anything really.,0
"I've been depressed these past few months, and today isn't helping at all.",1
"Thanks to whoever listened, it means more then you know.",0
I'm in denial my life is falling apart.,1
I'm such a negative person.,0
I'm not close to my family and I'm jealous my family is.,0
I don't have friends.,0
I recently married last month and my husband can't take mt own negativity that he even said go kill myself if I want.,0
I don't have anyone to talk to about mt problems and he is the only one.,0
But he's been scolding me.telling me this is my fault and he will help me only if I'm nice and not negative.,0
But thwn I'd have to fake it.,0
I feel so lost.,0
I feel like no one cares.,0
I've been crying for days.,1
I want to die but i'm afraid of the pain.,1
I wanna do drugs but i'm nercous entering a store to get them.,0
I might as well live a life with no meaning but whatsa the point.,0
I feel like I repress alot of my feelings because people around me have it worse.,0
Like I start to feel sad and then I tell myself I dont deserve to be sad cause I'm not in a shitty situation in life.,1
I end up feeling really numb most of the time and I get emotionally unavailable without even realizing it.,0
I've noticed I get angry for no reason and distance my self from everyone when I get lile this.,1
I know it's not just me who feels this way and I would love too hear some ways other people handle feeling like this.,0
No I fucking can’t.,0
I want to die.,1
I'm sorry that I complain so much I just don't know where else to go with this.,0
My mom and I fight alot over very stupid things and I don't know why.,0
She doesn't listen to logic or reason.,0
"If I tell her that I think a shirt is ugly and I don't want to try it on, then I shouldn't try it on because we won't get it anyway, but her response is ""I said to"" 

If I tell her I'm using my laptop, my sister has two, and is currently asleep, not using either laptop, use one of hers, she says ""No I want yours""

I always present things in a calm voice with logical reasoning and she finds it disrespectful that I don't just do everything she says at the drop of a hat.",0
Yes I know that she's my mom but that doesn't mean I have to follow her every command like a little servant.,0
"Family should be about open communication, but if you aren't allowing any conversation to happen, then why would I ever want to do anything.",0
"She says when I become a mom my kids are gonna be little shits and then I would wish I was nicer to her

Which wont happen because ive gone through enough shit to know the exact way to treat them, the way i wanted to be treated but my mother didnt do.",0
"Not constantly yelling at them or hitting them

but treating them like actual people with feelings and opinions that are just as valid as mine.",0
"My mom doesn't seem to get that, I don't think age should make your feelings or opinions more valuable than someone who is younger, especially if that someone is your own child.",0
she said god will punish me for my actions but how is speaking logically and explaining things reasonably a sin.,0
"There's a line in the quran that says   
Be the best you can be for your parents

that means  
the best *i*  can be, not the best they expect me to be, like some perfect daughter robot

They use that line alot like ""it says in the quran you should never say no to your parents no matter what"" and im here like  
thats

a very big misinterpretation.",0
"Idk

im just

upset

and tired

this is the fourth day in a row something like this has happened

and she says shes marking my behavior so that i wont get what i want for my birthday

meanwhile i dont even want a birthday for this reason exactly

they make it something you have to earn

like they do with everything

all i want for my birthday is one day to be left alone and not talked to 

i want a party with my friends who dont constantly make me feel like dying

and absolutely nothing from my family

because then they cant say that i take from them and never give back

or i take advantage of them

sorry for all this",0
"Meta title, right?",0
I'm struggling to motivate myself and uphold relationships with people I care about.,1
All the passion I previously had for my course and my creative interests dwindles day by day and I'm not sure I can keep doing the things I do.,1
"I just want to stop but I dont want to disappoint everyone who expects me to be something, especially my mum.",0
"I've been having terrible, illogical issues with my family and had a terrifying fight tonight with a parent who threatened suicide and has pinned all blame on me, saying that I am the worst child of all time, ungrateful, useless, disappointing, not worthy of being proud of, worse than their previous physically abusive, cheating partner, etc.",1
"I said that I wouldnt be able to live if they commited suicide, and they told me they wouldnt care if I killed myself.",1
"Ive always been a fairly logical person, but Im losing motivation to continue like this.",1
I cant escape this and I dont know what to do.,0
I feel like Im driving away my partner and friends with this issue I cant fix and Im falling deeper into depression.,1
I feel worthless and alone.,1
"I've been living like a degenerate for about half a year, but I finally managed to eek out the will to at least clean the garbage in my room a week ago.",0
"Today, my goal is to do the same for my car and hell maybe even do my laundry.",0
I know these are basic skills but I've been letting the crap pile up for too long and well... Baby steps yeah?,0
"I hope some of you manage to find the will to do one, even if tiny positive thing for yourself.",0
Cheers.,0
Im sitting in a toilet stall.,0
I’m trying my best to suppress my crying.,1
My sobbing.,0
Life has been so fucking difficult.,1
I can barely type because I can’t see anything with tears running down my face.,0
Me and my boyfriend are constantly fighting because we’re both jealous motherfuckers.,0
"He tells me to always say what’s wrong, and when I do he gets so mad because 90% of the time it’s because of him.",0
I’m so empty inside.,0
"I have happy times, I can laugh and enjoy life, but the darkness always takes over.",1
I’m not happy anymore.,1
I’m not me anymore.,0
"I hate myself and anyone who tells me that I’m pretty, funny, a nice friend ect.",1
will be seen as liars in my eyes.,0
"I don’t know what to do anymore, I’m worthless.",1
"Honestly completely, utterly worthless.",1
If I’m lucky I will be involved in a car crash.,1
Maybe killed in my sleep.,1
I’m afraid to die but at least it will end the suffering.,1
I don’t know how much longer I can do this.,0
I’m mean to my family because I have misophonia.,0
I can’t be in the same room as my mom without tearing up from anger.,1
I hate being this way towards them.,0
My mom is visibly upset because of this.,0
I can see she struggles to smile when I am being mean to her.,0
I don’t mean to.,0
I don’t know how to stop because I’m a self-pitying monster.,0
I don’t remember the last time something WASN’T wrong in my life.,0
There’s always something to complain about and to be sad about.,1
I don’t want to feel like this anymore.,0
I’ve had so many people hurt me.,0
I’m not strong anymore.,0
I can’t fucking do this.,0
"I can,t take it all any longer.",0
"I have a underpayed stressfull mini job
and have anxiety about my future since i cant get a good Job because i had bad grades at school also i feel lonely and my friends dont understand me at all.",0
Never had a girl or some sort of sucess in my life all i do is mediocre and not enaugh i think the world dosent need me.,1
The last thing why im not doing it is for my family because they still belive in me.,0
"Im just trying to talk to people that maybe can understand me maybe it helps


Sry 4 bad english im from germany.",0
My partner is killing me with his attitude towards substances.,0
He gets mad at me for pills and alcohol and then goes and drinks and smokes weed.,0
"I understand if he doesn't want me to do to myself what he does to himself, but that's stupid as hell.",0
The same reason he needs is the same reason I need it.,0
It's just annoying that it's so wrong for me but necessary for him.,0
So yesterday I went on my first date in probably two and a half years.,0
I texted her this morning haven’t heard back and got me thinking about how badly I want to be in a relationship.,0
I wanted to talk to someone about it and realized all my friends moved away and I had no body around.,0
Does anyone else feel like they could disappear tomorrow and no one would really care?,0
"my dad has no job, no car, and without welfare, no house.",0

I stopped hanging out with people and I still feel awkward idk this is really stupid but I’m just really confused if I even like girls idk.,1
I feel stuck in this world right now.I feel so terrible for existing and taking up someone else's place on earth.,1
Everything I do ends is failure.I don't even know how others tolerate me.I basically screw up everything I do and I hate myself for it.,1
"Everything about me is terrible.My body,My voice,everything.I'm ashamed to here my voice in recordings because it's incredibly laughable.It disgusts me.",1
I hope none of you feel like how I do right now.A broken shell of a person...,1
"When I'm feeling like this at the age of 17,I doubt I'll get better with all my social and medical problems.",1
I really don't know what I should feel.,0
"Definitely lonely, maybe sad.",0
I know there are people out there who had it worse than me.,0
Maybe am just emotionally unstable.,0
I am from an Asian country.,0
"First few weeks of school, I was constantly crying because I was afraid.",1
I was also bullied by 2 seniors in the school bus because of that.,0
"Apart from that, my first 3years in class was fine.",0
"My grades dropped as I became lazy, and stops doing homework, my teacher called my parents up, and I get cane almost every month by my dad.",1
That's myself to blame.,0
"However, the next 3years I was bullied for almost every single day.",0
"My bully will always asked me for money, and threatens to call my family for it if I don't give him.",0
"As someone who's gullible/naive, I thought I was protecting them.",0
I blame myself for being stupid too.,0
I stole money from my parents and my uncle.,0
I even gave him my uncle's psp in hope he will stops bullying me.,0
"My uncle found a psp casing in my bag, I told him I brought to school and lost it.",0
My relationship with him became worse since.,0
We stopped talking and treats each other like strangers.,0
"Other than being bullied in school, I was bullied by my three cousins.",0
They also threaten to tell my dad and uncle if I don't listen to them.,0
"Now that I've grown older, I realised what they did is way worse than my bully in school.",0
"Again, I was too stupid to realised it.",0
I was 7-12years old throughout all this things.,0
I repeated one year as I failed one of the major exam which determines whether you graduate.,0
My 7th year in that school (13years old) was good.,0
"No bullies, I was happy.",0
"I also forget to mention, I cheated my friends money just to pay the bully, and in the end I got no friends because of that.",0
On to secondary(high school?),0
"school, it was great.",0
I got no bullies.,0
"However, there's racism in the class, but nothing too serious.",0
"I made 2 good friends, and they always think of me as a happy go lucky girl with no stress, but they don't know that I cry almost everyday at home and to sleep.",1
"I don't blame them, because I don't know how to open up and share my problems or even tell them what I've been through.",0
"Apart from that, ever since we graduated, we barely talk anymore.",0
One of them have migrated.,0
"They are the only 2 friends I get along with for the 4years in school, I do talk to other classmates just that we don't sit together during breaks or even hangout.",1
"Only when both my friends are not in school, that's when I sit together with other classmates which is very awkward for me.",1
Luckily that's not often.,0
I was 14-17years old.,0
College.. the first few months were fine but somehow I just distant away from everyone.,1
"I find myself not clicking with anyone, not able to talk.",1
I became really quiet.,0
"To the point where for the rest of 1 and the half year in school, I am always eating by myself, and I was embarrassed being seen.",1
I normally sit at the table outside class so I try to avoid table near my class but sometimes my classmates will still walk past.,1
The only time I talk to my classmates was during group work which was almost every day since I was studying media/filming.,0
"Normally the talking was just giving each other roles or task, that's all.",0
I am 18-19years old then.,0
I graduated but didn't attend graduation.,0
"Still in college, but this time a different course(IT related).",0
"Things were good, I made friends, I get along with almost everyone.",0
You can hear my voice shouting across of class calling my friends.,0
Teachers were annoy by me sometimes.,0
I am constantly walking around the class talking to my friends.,0
"But I guess ever since we graduated, we became distant.",0
"I barely talk to them, and don't even meet them anymore.",1
"Despite one of them having badminton session every Saturday, but I've never been to it once.",1
"They tend to share their problems to me, but I've never once share problems of mine to them.",0
"3 of them were from the media/filming course just that we were in different class except for lecture, but I didn't know them back then until now.",0
One of them did bring up about how I looked like I was really lonely when I was in the previous course with my other friends when they were asking each other of their first impression with one another.,0
I even try to come up with excuses just to let them know I wasn't.. but I was.,0
Age 20-22.,0
I graduated this month but I didn't attend.,1
"18th and 21st birthday is supposed to be special, I had no one to celebrate with.",1
I don't think anyone of them knows when's my birthday too.,0
"I did badly in all my school, I didn't studied all this time(I hate studying but certificate is a must in society).",1
Now I am stuck.,0
Not sure what to do for now..,0
I have plans to further study and the application date is in Nov.,0
"I dyed my hair recently, blue.. and it seems rather difficult to find a job with this hair colour.",0
"I regret it, at the same time I don't.",0
I love the colour and always wanted it.,0
I've never really had someone to share my problem with except for my ex-boyfriend..,0
"I feel like my whole life, it's just because of stupid choices I've made.",0
I feel sad but not to the point that I am depressed although I do breakdown occasionally.,1
I had a friend in primary school who cuts herself but she snapped out of it ever since in secondary school.,0
"She made good choices in her life, and now she's happy and doing great in her life.",0
"My relationship with my uncle is on and off, it was normal until last year where we treat each other like strangers again because we quarreled after moving into a new home as I did not help much in unpacking stuff and settling and this year about me not washing the spoon properly as there's still peanut butter on it.",1
"I am a careless person, I blame myself for that too but it's hard for me to change that.",0
"It's not something that happens often, so I don't get why he can't just look the other way and help one another as family.",0
Maybe because of what I stole from him.,0
He became bias to me and is much closer with my cousins.,0
"I also did sign up for dating sites to meet new people but am always quiet on dates, so the guys will eventually just unmatched me or stop replying to me if we did exchange texting platforms.",1
"I used to join chat groups in secondary school, tries to meet new people but I just fails..",0
I guess am just not a people person.,0
I hate going out alone because I feel embarrassed but I still do so which is rarely.,1
"Most of the time I just coop up at home, and I enjoy that a lot.",0
Just binge watching shows.,0
Although loneliness will hits you after awhile.,0
I really appreciate it if you read the whole thing.,0
Sorry if there's part that is repeated.,0
I hope I didn't waste your time.,0
I am Depressed.,1
I don't have friends.,0
I have zero motivation to further my life and all i want to do is absolute nothing.,1
There is nothing or anyone who has been able to help me.,0
I just feel like giving up.,1
I am not calling for help or asking anyone to respond.,0
At this point i think i am just venting.,0
If i where to disappear there would be nothing other than my family getting hurt.,0
In time i know they would be able to accept me being gone.,0
I am alright i am not going to kill myself.,0
I just know that it wouldn't affect much if i was gone.,0
I am Depressed.,1
In not sure what I'm doing.,0
I know I don't want to spend another day asleep.,0
I took a shower.,0
Made a shopping list.,0
And plan to go to the store.,0
"Once I'm home, I'll pick up the trash.",0
Scoop the cat box.,0
Then do the laundry that has to be done for tomorrow.,0
"I feel blank, I can make choices.",0
I don't know what else to say.,0
Or why I said this much.,0
Thinking of those who feel like me and hoping they are trying today too.,0
And wanting to tell them it's okay to lose time.,0
You'll get going again.,0
I wrote a song about how my old group of friends completely left one day.,0
How can 5 of the closest friends ever just leave like that.,0
These motherfuckers we're by my side day and night and then they weren't.,0
This was months ago but it sent my already fragile emotional health into complete darkness.,1
I started running from everyone in my life went through at least 6 girls over the summer.,0
Drank so much and smoked so much I felt like I was wasnt alive.,1
This was months ago but I wrote this song to leave them behind to finally say goodbye.,0
This has been the only thing to happen to me that I can't leave behind in a song.,0
I still feel the pain in my heart I still see their smiles behind my eyes.,0
I still hear their laughter in my ears I still remember all the time we spent.,0
I even hung out with one if them yesterday.,0
He forgot about most of the stuff we did together.,0
I never forgot.,0
Edit: I was at a party with all of them at one of their houses.,0
I had been going through some brutal shit recent.,0
We all got baked and drunk as fuck and then I had a lil mental breakdown and I guess I scared them off.,1
All I know it they stopped talking to me since then and I'm never allowed back.,0
Edit: recorded the song and it's really good so that's a thing,0
Sometimes especially at night like it is for me now.,0
I just get the urge to clean out my bank accounts and just disappearing.,0
I'd leave a note to my family telling them I've gone and not to try to find me.,0
I feel so empty and alone.,1
So backstory.,0
I'm a 36-year old fat person who mostly hates myself for various reasons.,1
I was a caregiver for my mom who got sick from breast cancer and chemo and declined shortly after that and got worse when my dad ended up in prison back in 2014.,0
I could be off on the year cause the past year the days have kinda blended together and for the most part I can't remember a lot.,0
So I took care of my mom and worked a shitty job but it was a job (Arbys).,0
"Around Feb 2018 mom got worse and around March she went into a nursing home (She would go into one often, but I finally convinced her that she would be better in one long-term and we finally found one she liked) and I took a full-time job that was gonna be better than my PT junk-hole.",0
"Also, we had roommates which sometimes changed but it was extra sources of income or such.",0
My mom was a caring person who didn't want people we knew to be homeless and such so we let people stay for little sums of money or helping with things around the house.,0
"&#x200B;

So March she's in a nursing home, I have a job that I tolerated for better money, and I get a call stating that mom made too much money in the past 5 years to qualify for Medicaid (or care, whichever is the senior one) so she had to come back to the house.",0
I also get informed that she requested to be put on hospice and they would move the services as Hospice at Home.,0
"So she comes back, I become FT caregiver, and she slowly lets go.",0
"My mom passed on May 1st, 2018.",0
"I'm kinda destroyed since my mom was my world and I tried to care for her but I feel like I let her down, But I persevere through.",0
"May 16th, my dad passes in prison.",0
"Still kinda in shock from mom, it's softened since it all hit at once.",0
"Didn't really think about the ripples till later on when I can't handle anything that was moms (we never set a will, cause I didn't wanna think about it thinking she was still young at 65 and she WAS getting better at first nor did she wanna talk about; Yes I know I fucked up) without dealing with a probate lawyer which I don't have any money as it is.",0
"&#x200B;

I've been stuck in a rut since they both passed and every time I try to get back on my feet, I fail.",0
Mostly cause of me as I give up trying at times.,1
"I've been in the process of trying to empty out this house (it was their home, but there's still a mortgage and the bank filed a foreclosure in December so I know I have to empty it out but every time I start to, I get sidetracked, find something of theirs and then fall back into a spiral of self-loathness and hatred) .",1
I feel like I'm failing myself as I failed them.,1
I'm failing my son as I haven't seen him in months.,1
"I tried to have another roommate in June after mom passed, and they left after stealing my TV and not paying anything.",0
I then tried another roommate in August and they left without paying so I was w/o water from the end of August - December when a family member helped me out.,0
I had gotten a job somewhere in September and another friend bought me a gym membership so I could shower there and still work.,0
"It feels as if when I had less, I rose up and handled things, but now I'm ok at home with a job (still shitty at 10-18 hrs a week despite trying to get more hours) I figuratively fall and can't get back up.",1
"&#x200B;

I honestly feel like I'm a failure at life and the only thing that's really stopped me from hurting myself is I don't want my son to experience the heartbreak of something like that.",0
"I don't want him to think he'll grow up to become someone like me if I killed myself, but I don't want him to become someone like me as I am now.",1
"I've even been told I could try to make money with my voice (I sound like the Arbys guy who says we have the meats, which actually helped me when I worked there to get tips) but I'm so lost and disorientated most of the time I don't know how to get started with something like that.",1
I mostly drink my days away or smoke green.,0
I don't like being sober cause then the reality of things set in.,0
I wanna die but refuse to kill myself.,1
&#x200B;,0
"We all need space, and if this time apart from a person of interest is not met, they often get tired of us.",0
"Maybe relationships of any kind weren't meant to last forever because we are all comparable to lost souls with paths that intersect at a part in life, but never really become collinear.",0
"&#x200B;

And even if I know that this is true, it still doesn't take the pain away from every single friendship, relationship, family relative that I lose no matter how hard I try or how hard I strive to be a ""better person"".",0
"&#x200B;

Because at the end of the day, I have no one else but myself, so I blame my misfortune on my inability to be enough to the people I care and love the most.",0
"So, it’s my first post here.",0
"It’s another one of those days if you could relate, but for me it’s one of those life because the pains and sufferings never ends.",1
"I experienced domestic abuse as a child, went on to being bullied three times in separate schools and another two times in my last school and now, I am being constantly coerced by my superior at work and quite frankly, finding it real hard to live at the moment.",1
"Headstrong as a child, never afraid to stand up for what I believe in, like fairness and equality, could never stand anyone getting treated unjust.",0
"The inappropriate righteousness put myself outcast several times in school and thereafter, ended up with depression and anxiety, became highly reclusive and socially awkward.",1
"Due to the above experiences, I became a people-pleaser.",0
Constantly trying to get on everyone’s side and not step on anyone’s toe.,0
"The extreme paranoia and efforts to make people happy is taxing, but much better than being picked on again.",0
"That said, it made me.. not me anymore.",0
I knew who I was before all these.. ~LiFe ExPeRiEnCe~ but I’m not the same.,0
"Throughout, I have nearly committed suicide and self-harm for quite a bit which isn’t honorary so as to speak, but I’m not gonna say I’m glad I survived.",1
"Anyhow, my closest friends moved several states away and a few other oceans apart.",0
"I have no one but pile on pile of bills, physical health cracking under the mental torture my superior puts me through; reached out to HR to no avail just because the superior has got more years in the company than me, but the only way for me to leave is to the fines for terminating the contract, which should be fine, just a few more months of work.",1
"Yet, after that.. what then?",0
"I’m thinking of going back to school, to college but well, way more people there and I’m so so traumatized by everything I’ve barely gotten enough energy to wake up every damn day.",1
"TDLR; Abused and bullied multiple times throughout, at school and at work.",0
Ended up with piles of debt and a huge wreck on physical and mental health.,1
"Thinking of ways to get out of this shit-hole but frankly, just want to die but know that I’ll be again shitted for feeling this way.",1
So shoot me I guess!!,0
not sure what’s my point for this!,0
Birthdays are supposed to be a celebration of life.,0
But Today is my birthday and all I can think about is that I want to die.,1
"&#x200B;

I am about halfway though college but I've haven't been taking classes for three semesters now.",0
Ever since I got out of the hospital I just can't seem to do it.,0
"If all (or even just some) had gone according to plan, I'd be graduating this year.",0
"Around now, I'd either be looking into full time jobs or studying for the GREs and looking at PhD programs.",0
But it didn't and I'm not.,0
I just sit around and try to come up with reasons not to kill myself.,1
I think im actually done.,0
I cant do this anymore,0
I have ptsd.,0
I've been okay for awhile except this week.,0
I left a decent job for a better job and lost it cause im mentally and physically unreliable.,1
I was mean to my kid I just am a loser in general and now on suicide watch under my husband.,1
I need some distraction.,0
"Hi, 

Looking to see if other people have gone through this or have experienced about the same.",0
"I know this is more like a ramble and venting, but any insight you can give would be appreciated.",0
"Last week, I quit my job after scrutiny of two weeks over my work output, being told it wasn’t enough etc although I worked hard and did my best.",1
"So now, their mentality is affecting me at home too to a greater degree than usual.",0
I do what I can even trying to schedule my time but I feel like it’s not enough of what I end up doing.,0
"Like, I think it’s the little things in between that’s causing this (like going outside to do grocery shopping, using restroom, daydreaming, snack and meal breaks, and minor distractions) but even then, I’m amazed at how time flies so quickly and the next thing you know it’s like 11 pm.",0
"So right now, I feel like a failure after a week has gone by.",1
I’ve applied to about 22 jobs so far and no call backs yet except scams.,0
"I also have little motivation of studying, as I do the bare minimum when it comes to studying for school (trying to get my bachelor’s).",1
"I’m not saying anything I haven’t seen several times in the top few posts, but I need to get this out and telling strangers feels like the best way since I don’t want to burden my friends or family with my depression, which is a weird thought, because I would love it if they came to me when they were depressed because I know I would be understanding and loving, but there’s that voice in my head that keeps telling me that they will start looking at me differently, possibly even pity me.",1
"To the cause of this current spell of depression, I basically feel like I don’t fit in anywhere.",1
I grew up in a religious household.,0
"I have spent years in and out of church as an adult and while I’m not super into religion, I have adopted a lot of its moralistic views because they make sense to me.",0
"The problem is that now I feel not religious enough for the church groups, much less to find a spouse among them, but I have many contradictory morals to my more worldly friends.",0
"A few months back, I found a board game meetup group that met once a week at a local game shop.",0
"I was timid at first, but got to know them and their stories and finally felt like I found my home.",0
"Then one guy fell for a girl who wasn’t interested back, but was for someone else and they stopped being around each other and they were among my best friends in the group and now I never see them anymore.",0
"Up until last week, I hosted dinners and mini game nights at my place with various other people from the group, but lately, it’s just felt like those friendships have just stagnated and with a few of them, the more time I spent with them, the less interested I was in spending time with them.",1
"Last week, on valentine’s day no less, my sister’s mother-in-law came from where I used to live to visit my sister (who lives across town) and brought back the ring from my ex-fiancée.",0
"Now I have this reminder that I used to have someone that I could be completely open and vulnerable with and now it feels like I would just be a burden on everyone, so it’s better if I just secluded myself.",1
"I went to game night tonight, hoping I could pull myself out of my funk, but I was already fighting to join in, and instead opted to sit on the couch across the room for everyone playing games.",0
"No one came to invite me to play or see how I was doing, so 40min in, I just left and went home to feel sorry for myself.",0
"The worst part of this all is that logically, I know that it’s all in my head.",0
No one has slighted me.,0
I haven’t been wronged.,0
"When I brought up that I was feeling a bit down, I was the one who got hurt when a couple of my friends decided to just say “hope you feel better” instead of “do you want to talk about it?” or “let’s do something to get your mind off of it.” Even when I told my sister about that dilemma and she asked if I wanted to talk about it, I was the one who felt like it was totally contrived that she even asked and not authentic (which it more than likely totally was authentic because she’s my sister and she loves me).",0
"No one has been mean to me, I have a roof over my head and food in my cupboards.",0
I have tons of friends.,0
"I’m sure if I opened up to many of them, they’d tear down heaven and earth to bring me back up, but depression is a nasty devil that throws reasonable thinking in the furnace.",0
"Alright, well this was five paragraphs too long and I doubt anyone has read all of it.",0
I do feel slightly better getting it all down in writing at the very least.,0
A lot of the time I fucking hate life.,1
"It's monotonous, grating, and lonely.",0
A lot of the time I feel like I have no one there and there's no where to go but farther down.,0
"I feel like there's two people in my life who genuinely care about me, and one I can never see due to her and her boyfriends relationship and the other just doesn't ""get"" me sometimes.",0
"The former I may very well (still) be in love with, so that's a hard one.",0
"We had a relationship in the past that I, addmitedly, did fuck up, but a *lot* has changed since then, and I am a much better, more affectionate man now.",0
Not a day goes by I don't think about her and our past and what I hope can become a future.,0
"Not a day goes by I don't crave the sneaking aura of joy and warmth ever present around her, eminating from every pore of her being, her sparkling blue-green eyes that shine from her gorgeous face and give such an eloquent juxtaposition to the dark waves of brown-blonde that brush her sides.",0
I know I can do it right this time.,0
I know I'm ready to give her 1000% of my love.,0
Forever.,0
"The other, platonically, I also love, and I know they love me but yet so often I still feel so fucking alone.",0
And it seems like 80% of the population is just fucking straight stupid.,0
People don't know the most obvious common sense shit and all anyone cares about is faking their lives for the greatest amount of social points.,0
"I mean I can change, sure, but I'm not going to become someone completely different to please the most amount of people around me.",0
"It seems ironic in comparison with my previous point, but it's different.",0
"I seek genuine companionship, just a few people who will be there for you no matter what, it seems most seek the greatest quantity of attention feasible from any given situation.",0
And every day it's wake up.,0
Go to school.,0
Go to work.,0
Dinner.,0
Shower.,0
Bed.,0
Over and over again in a bullshit suburb.,0
"I want the mountains, I want trees, the beautiful essence of nature that fills your soul and rattles your bones with an undying raw energy tapped straight from Mother Earth herself.",0
But here we it seems all we tap is the life from our spirit.,0
"And so I sit, another night, alone.",0
Missing my joy.,0
Missing all that once showered me in happiness.,0
"But most of all, missing my old girl.",0
I am slowly distancing myself away from reality.,0
"I don't want to do anything in my life, I lost my interest for most of the things I enjoyed and I am starting to lose my friends.",1
I feel numb in a way.,0
I push myself to do work and I feel empty without having anything to do.,0
For the first time I'm my life I had a chance to laze around and not do anything but that makes me feel useless instead of relaxed.,1
"There is nothing I currently want, I planned events in my life but they all just seem like chores to me.",0
"I feel like my mind is on a whole different level to the reality, as if I'm a ghost who's floating around.",0
"I am gaining a lot of toxic relationships too, I realized that people I began to surround myself around are all rude and cruel.",0
I can't stop being needy to others and I wish this would all just stop.,0
Sorry for my English ...,0
"When I'm zoning, I feel like Zeus.",0
"I feel like I can speak to any motherfucker out there, young, old, pretty and brainy.",0
"I am a real charmer in my true, natural form.",0
Charismatic to the bone.,0
"However, when I look good I have no place to be at.",0
When I have all these amazing things to say I have no ears to listen to them.,0
"When I have all this friendship willing to give, I have nobody to receive it.",0
I was too stubborn in my teens to go party... and I don't drink so there is little room for me there.,0
"My friends are lifeless people, I need the guys from the movies.",0
We are too dissimilar.,0
"&#x200B;

I am somebody who can thrive in a social environment, but has been forced to live in extreme isolation through stubbornness, cynicism and nihilistic foundations.",0
"I can't just ""get out there"" because I have never been 'there'.",0
I don't know where 'there' is or how to get 'there'.,0
"I won't make REAL friends or have any relationship because I have reduced myself to the 'school-shooter persona', even though I'm actually a friendly, approachable sweetheart.",0
"&#x200B;

I couldn't ever kiss or hug my family because I tried to act like I was love-averse.",0
"&#x200B;

I want to cuddle my nieces and be a person who lives by his heart but I am seemingly incapable of breaking self-image.",0
"&#x200B;

I don't deserve myself.",0
Most days are good.,0
I push through days for my husband and my step son.,0
I dont know if i can do it anymore.,0
My husband doesnt get depression and I always feel alone and like hes angry.,1
He tells me hes tired of the same argument with no result.,0
I cant help it some days are easier other days I dont want to leave my bed.,1
Other days I wish I wasnt here.,1
I'm just a waste of space.,1
I think of divorcing him all the time because I think he would be happier.,0
I'm laying here in bed crying and he says well there goes the holiday weekend went to shit.,1
Hes unhappy with me.,0
Me being gone would make life so much easier and he would be better off.,0
Al I do is bring him down and upset him.,0
I dont know why hes still with me.,0
"According to all the 5 girls I've liked I am a great friend, but that's it.",0
"5th one just happened, and it was a serious punch to the gut.",0
At this point it's definitely me.,0
Am I not supposed to be loved?,0
"That's a really scary thought, living life without being loved.",0
If that's gonna be my life I'm not gonna live it.,1
Thanksgiving was fine but today...I feel like I'm sliding back into the deep parts of depression.,1
Mauve it was the fact that I had to work today in what can only be described as the prolasped asshole area of Georgia.,0
I've been trying to distract myself this whole shift from thinking about it.,0
"Tried some YouTube videos, lot of gone wild subreddits, some podcast.",0
Didn't help.,0
Keep thinking that there are two pistols at my folks house.,0
It would have been easy.,0
Everything would finally become quiet.,0
I probably wouldn't have been able to do it.,0
Not with them on the house.,0
I do have a knife in the car tgough...,0
It's weird that I'm kind of annoyed that I probably can't go through with it.,0
I feel like I want to do it.,0
There is this tiny grain of resistance that keeps telling to hang on.,0
I know it can get better because I've been here before but I'm not seeing any signs that it will.,0
I'm trying to take my own advice but I'm really struggling man.,0
It's way harder than its ever been.,0
I just want to make it through this.,0
Today is a day.,0
This is the second day I woke up feeling completely useless and just down.,1
I need a day to just vegetate and relax.,0
"I phoned in sick yesterday (stomach flu), today I would have had to lie to take a day off because telling my boss I can come in because my mind is overwhelmed with life and my medication is not working as quickly today wouldn’t be a sufficient reason for me to take a day off.",1
"I am a 16 year old girl, he is 17, i was just chilling when this guy started messaging me, apparently he is a stalker, he knows my name, and talks to me like i know him, he showed me his arm which is filled with cuts, 4 cuts horizontally, with my name carved into his skin, with a heart, then a A ❤ N referring to our names, he is threatening to kill himself if i don't call him, im too afraid that if i told him i won't befriend him he would cut himself more or even kill himself!",0
"He has parents, goes to school, and doesn't have any reason to cut as far as i know, i asked him what is the cutting about, he said to cherish the cut every time he remembers me.",0
This person is obsessed with me what do i fucking do?,0
!,0
So I’m not sure if I’m depressed or bipolar.,0
I’m a single 21 year old male.,0
I believe that life is meaningless and anything anyone has done or ever will do is absolutely pointless for one day it will all end.,1
"I’ve given up on finding a girlfriend, I have no ambitions or motivation.",1
"I am usually in an internal state, but sometimes there are spurts of perseverance (not sure if I have used that word correctly) and I sometimes have hope.",0
"Consequently, similar to a roller coaster rising and falling, I always go back into these dark states.",0
I have the feeling of wanting to die but I don’t want to comment suicide.,1
The thought of just not waking up isn’t so bad to me.,0
"My chest is literally always in a state of slight pain, even as I type this.",0
My whole body is falling apart faster than most adults my age.,0
"I hate my job, the place I live in, and roughly 90% of the people around me.",1
I cannot change my job or living situation until 2020 for I am bound by contract.,0
I don’t know what to do.,0
I feel pretty down.,0
"I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt about 6 years ago and, although I'm not at that stage, I feel so empty.",1
I meet with a psychiatrist weekly.,0
Mostly we talk about my relationships with my immediate family.,0
I'm becoming more and more aware that those relationships will always be strained and there is nothing I can do to fix it.,0
The family I do feel like I have is my friends.,0
"However, as we've gotten older, we have moved, both spatially and with regards to the closeness.",0
I don't feel comfortable with opening up.,0
I feel like I'm being judged for crying wolf.,0
"A handful of peole know about my hospitalization and whenever I try to open it about how I'm feeling currently, they ask me why don't I go to the hospital.",0
"When I say I'm not at that point, they become dismissive.",0
