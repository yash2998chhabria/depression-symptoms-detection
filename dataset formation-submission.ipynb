I sleep all day, I never join the family to eat or watch a movie, I spend all of my time in my room. I failed my classes, although I used to get straight A’s. I never go out anymore, I haven’t hung out with any of my friends in months. I don’t even walk my dogs. Or at least that’s just what it looks like right?\\n\\nI’m not lazy. I hate it here. I’m miserable, my mind is in constant pain. Everything feels so heavy and difficult. Why do I have to participate in a life that just causes me so much pain? Why do I have to get a job, when doing so causes a massive downward spiral in my mental health? Why do I need to keep going to school when it makes me feel totally and utterly filled with dread and fear? Other people want me here more than I do. \\n\\nI feel like most people are given a shiny, fun, new toy, and some of us are given old dusty broken shit from the thrift store. And they wonder why we won’t just “play with it, live a little, have fun! Be happy with what you’ve got! Enjoy it!”  Like, I’m sorry for hating it. I’m sorry for hating my life. I’m sorry my brain doesn’t do shiny, fun, cool things, and it resembles the broken toy a bit more. People who have never experienced serious mental health issues have no idea what it’s like for us. If their toy gets a scratch, they can polish it. My toy is way too broken to even bother trying to polish it. It’s so invalidating and exhausting to even exist near people who don’t understand because I can feel the constant judgement. \\n\\nWhen normal people feel sad, they can watch a movie or call a friend to cheer themselves up. And it genuinely works for them. I can’t escape the brokenness of my mind even when I’m “happy”. It’s always there, and I can always feel it no matter what. Lately, the weight has been too heavy to bear. So I know it looks like it, but I promise I’m not lazy. I’m just trying to stay afloat.',\n",

       "  'My brother committed suicide on April 6, 2019. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a Saturday and I went out early in the morning with my friend to go help her find her prom dress. I was 15 years old at the time and, Yeah, I’m a guy, but I also have good taste. Anyways, I spent most of the day with her and I eventually came back home at around 5 pm. My mom made some crawfish (one of my favorite seafoods) and I ate a bunch when I got home. Eventually, my mom came home with groceries and things. I got him a vans jacket (we already had it but for some reason they left the alarm thing on it) and my mom went to go check up on him and give him the jacket. Meanwhile, I was outside getting all the groceries. Suddenly, I heard my mom scream like I never heard before. I dropped the groceries and ran inside to my brothers room. There was blood on his bed, the floor, and part of the walls. The smell was something that I never smelt before, it was absolutely terrible. My mom kept shaking my brother. And I had to call the police. The operator was asking if he had a pulse and I kept saying no. The operator kept saying to go check but I just knew. I also had to make sure that my little sister didn’t see any of this. I actually remained very calm because I knew that any amount of distress and the situation would be worst. I had to be there for my mom and my sister at the time. The police came around 5 minutes during the call. Multiple cops actually showed up and an ambulance. My mom was still covered in his blood and explaining to the police what happened. She thought he was playing at first but realized that something was extremely wrong. My whole family came rushing to the house. I had to explain to my sisters that I wasn’t joking and this isn’t a prank and that my brother actually shot himself in the head. The police didn’t leave till 10:30 pm that night and I didn’t even want to sleep in my room much less the house. I slept at my older sisters house that night, and the night after that, and the week after. My room is right next to his so it took me awhile till I could actually sleep in my room again.\\n\\nMoving on to the future, it turns out he was already announced deceased about 30 minutes prior to me getting to the home. The thought of him being deceased while I was home and me not knowing was terrifying. We didn’t really talk so I honestly didn’t know. The doctors told us that the bullet didn’t come out the other side and was stuck inside his head. They told us that he became a vegetable before he passed so he didn’t feel anything. Thank god. My brother was in band at school. The whole band came together and help the go fund me to pay for his funeral. It worked, we successfully paid for everything. Ever since everything, everyone obviously hasn’t been the same.\\n\\nThe reason why I’m writing this is that, it isn’t worth committing suicide. People are worth it and you are worth it. You belong on this earth for a reason. The pain that this had caused to my family won’t go away after awhile, maybe never. You can get through all of this.

After college, I worked at big companies like Amazon, a large credit card company and then Google. \\n\\nI was a contractor for Google I did the same job as the full-time employees but Google didn't have to give me benefits or pay me for a full year as I would work 6-9 months at a time. Well... they didn't need me this year, so I worked for a start-up it was a shit show I was the only women in the Chicago office. I got along with my male colleagues great, but the manager of the Chicago team who was located in San Fran was a woman and just treated me very unfairly because she was threatened or something insane who knows. So I quit like an idiot because who could predict there would be a national pandemic and now I cannot find work and my online business has tanked and I have no money because instead of saving I tried paying off debt and all my credit cards are maxed out.

       "  \"Hi guys,\\n\\nMy name’s Phil, and I'm an 18 years old male. I’ve never done anything like this before. But, I thought it could help at least one person (maybe even myself) so I’m going to give it a try. Here’s the story of my years-long battle.\\n\\nI would consider my life up until the age of four to be quite normal; I was good at making friends, I had a very childish “romance” with a girl at preschool, and I lived in a stable household. It was on my fourth birthday where my life started to tread downhill. My parents had invited my best friend from preschool over to my house for my birthday party. From what I remember, the party was quite swell. I had cake and such and such, typical party. After it was over, my best friend invited me to spend the night at his house. I begged my parents, and they conceded. I ate dinner there and we were soon sent to bed (if you find it hard to read about molestation, skip to the next paragraph. I’m going to be very frank about my experience). Now, before I continue, I must say that I still think about this night vividly on occasion 14 years after it happened, and it makes me sick to my stomach every time. It has become harder and harder to make out all the details with the passing years, but how it felt is still engraved into my brain. It has made me feel like less of a man, and very much like a tool made to be used. Well, here I go. After we entered our respective beds, my friend says he wanted to try something on me that his father had done to him. I agreed. I had absolutely no clue what he meant, but next thing I knew he had put himself into my bed and did exactly what he said he would do. The same thing his father had done to him. I refuse to go into more detail for both my and your sake. After this point, it was a blur. I remember telling my mother about it and that’s about it.\\n\\nAfter that night I had never felt the same. \\n\\nA year passed and I had enter elementary school. I didn’t have the same ability I once had to make friends with other kids. This was the beginning of my ostracization. As the years increased, so did my weight. By the end of elementary school, I weighed roughly 210lb. The increase continued into middle school where I hit a max, of I believe, 270lb. I hated myself, I was fat, friendless, and most importantly, loveless. At this point, my parents’ marriage was starting to show cracks. There was constant fighting. These fights primarily were a result of my half-sister who at the time was a heroin addict (I believe she has now recovered, but I don’t know for sure). I started to grow angry at this time. Very angry. Angry at the world, my parents, and myself. I hated everything. I was very eager to start fights and to stick it to people. I remember physically assaulting a number of people that I would have considered friends because they caused me the slightest annoyance, specifically one boy, I hit multiple times. I have never said sorry to any of these people (if you happen to read this, I’m very sorry). I probably hurt them greatly and ruined their trust in others.\\n\\nThis anger lasted until high school where it turned into competitiveness. After developing this personality trait, I lost 100lb, which reinforced it. I had to win everything. If I didn’t, I would break down. I’ve famously punched many walls, leaving many dents. As you can probably imagine this wasn’t healthy. This level of competitiveness slowly turned into sadness. With everything I mentioned up until now: my inability to make friends, my anger, my competitiveness, and my unattractive physical appearance I was one of the most hated individuals within my school. My very complicated personality mixed with my standing with my peers led to depression. I became very depressed during my junior year of high school. I was having very bad depressive episodes every night. It started to noticeably affect my school work (at this time I was fourth in my class out of 110), I felt like I had to work even harder to maintain what I had, all I had, which was my grades. To make things worse, this is when my parents got divorced. To be frank, I didn’t cry, I didn’t care. After developing my weird personality, my parents had no value to me, but it still worsened my depression.\\n\\nOn a day, during the November of 2018, I tried to kill myself (if you have a hard time reading about suicide, skip to the next paragraph). This is something, just like my molestation, I have a very hard time talking about, so I’m going to keep it brief. I had decided to live with my father after the divorce, and he had a 9mm in his bedroom closet. On a day that he was off on business, I decided I was going to do it. I didn’t even write a note, I didn’t want to be remembered, I wanted to be silent. I remember loading it and putting it to my head. I sat there, and I sat there. Eventually, my mind brought me to this girl who had been very kind to me over the last year and how sad she would be if this was the route I took. So I put the gun down, and I cried.\\n\\nNow, a year and a half later, here I am. I’m now on 20mg of Lexapro after my doctor noticed my depression. I still experience depressive episodes now and then (a lot more recently because of the coronavirus outbreak). I’m now getting prepared to go to my dream college, and I feel like I have some semblance of control in my life. There is a lot I didn’t talk about in this, including my experiences with alcohol abuse and my personal relationship with the girl that in essence stopped my suicide, but I didn’t want to make this too long. Now that all is pretty much said and done, what advice can I give? \\n\\n-Live for the dreams you’ve yet to see materialize.\\n\\n-Live for the people you haven’t met that you’ll make smile.\\n\\n-And, given the aforementioned, live the life you want. Live the dreams *you* want, and make the people *you* want to smile. \\n\\nI hope this shows at least one person that they are not alone. If you think no one cares about your situation, I do. Thanks for reading this.\\n\\nPost: I wrote this at 3am. If there’s any errors, I’ll fix them in the morning. I’m sorry if it’s all over the place, I’m very bad at writing about myself. If you want to reach out to me and ask questions, feel free. Thanks again for reading this. I encourage anyone who has been through depression to post their story as well, there are many people hurting in the world right now.\\n\\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for the kind words. I’m happy to hear that some of you have taken inspiration from my story. That makes me extremely happy!\",\n",

       "  \"I’m 29/m and the last two years been a lesson to me, about friendship and being honest about my feelings, even though I’m still far from being where I want to be and probably never will be.\\n\\nIt all started about 2 years ago. I started to work in a call center, and I was still together with my long-term relationship (girl from another country, for 7 years). In this new job I met a really attractive girl called Janet who really was on the same level as me, I’m normally a real introvert person and it felt so good to be able to talk with someone and specially a girl in this way. We were laughing and talking during our breaks and later on been calling each other as the time went by.\\n\\nMeanwhile my long-term relationship was over, because of other reasons, she moved from another country to be with me but realized she isn’t happy here. It was and is no big deal for me, we are still friends and everything about it is fine.\\n\\nSo a period of partying, festivals and enjoying single life started for me after 7 years of being in a relationship, left some things to catch up. I never thought once about trying it with that Janet from work, we were always talking about what she was looking for in a relationship and what I am looking for, in the beginning she never sent me any signals. And over nearly a whole year it went on like this.\\n\\nBut after a few months something happened which made the whole story difficult. I met another girl called Nicole at our Christmas party (Janet didn’t go as she was ill), same department … we started to date, but one bad date followed the next, after like 10 months we got together (in between a long break) but I never felt this connection with her like I did with Janet. I always struggled with the situation because I knew she isn’t the one. But the time went on and we got along.\\n\\nI still met with Janet in our breaks and we went on calling each other and texting, but always in a friendzone way, but talking about very intimate stuff too. We were always talking about the relationship with Nicole in a funny way that she isn’t the one for me and when will I finally break up with her, but I just slowly I realized that Janet was serious about it.\\n\\nAfter another few months I finally made the decision to tell Nicole the truth that I don’t love honestly and want to break up. It was the worst feeling to break someone’s heart like this. It took me weeks to get used to it.One weekend I met with Janet and we had a really nice day together sightseeing a castle and talking and laughing the whole day.But at work things with Nicole became difficult, I saw her nearly every day at work and one day after about three weeks she confronted me and was crying in front of me asking me back. I became weak and after a while we got back together.\\n\\nThe thing is that I told Janet about the breakup and it made her happy, but back then I had no clue that she had more feelings for me…. When I told her about getting back with Nicole it broke her heart…\\n\\nThis went on for another few months, things changed, me and Janet didn’t talk anymore, and this fact made me really unhappy. Until things with Nicole went weird, she was always jealous about me talking to colleagues at work or when she found out that I was talking/texting with Janet in the past. I told her the thing with Janet is nothing and she forgave me.\\n\\nBut the next breakup with Nicole was just a matter of time, after the next Christmas party, when I was talking to all kinds of colleagues, she confronted me in front of everyone and I left. This was the moment I thought enough is enough. I told Nicole I break up now definitely and start a clean sheet and did he decision that I need to make things work with Janet again.\\n\\nI was afraid to talk to Janet, so I wrote a long text message, the longest I ever did. Basically, that I know now what I want, that I should have never risked our friendship and I feel like I’m just as bad as any other man and I will never forgive myself about what I did but I need to talk with her.Well, she replied with a voicemail which today still hurts me to think about, she told me that I will always be this way, that I hurt her a lot and she doesn’t want to give it another try with me.\\n\\nI replied that I’m really sad about it and that I had the best time with her …\\n\\nBack then I didn’t want to seem like an idiot and didn’t text her again.\\n\\nThis happened in December. Nearly 4 months later, I’m back together with Nicole. I can’t stop thinking about what a mistake I did with Janet and that I will never find a friend like her again and probably I would have had the best relationship with her. Nearly every day I think about breaking up with Nicole as it doesn’t feel right. And I know it’s not fair that I’m not honest to her about my feelings. Most of the days I have fun with Nicole as well, but it hurts me that I can’t love her the way I should and that I can’t stop thinking about Janet, even though she probably moved on already and doesn’t waste a thought on me.\\n\\nI don't know what to do to get over it, I just with everything would be the other way ...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSideinfo:\\n\\nJanet doesn’t work at that workplace anymore since last year October, so I don’t see her anymore and know what she is up to … every day I think about texting her and hoping that it could be all the way it was before but I can’t ignore the fact that she told me that it’s over between us.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate 12th April\\n\\nWell things took a fast turn in my story here - 3 days ago Nicole went through my stuff and found this post. From one moment to the other everything changed, shouting and crying started, I froze and couldn't explain properly what was going on, just that it's the truth. Not long after she left my place and since then I didn't hear anything of her anymore.\\n\\nIt's different than the times before as now I know that there is no way back anymore, what I did to her was horrible and god probably she won't be able to trust any man anymore. The last weeks we've been together 24/7 because of social distancing and working from home. We got along well actually and now that we broke up I feel like it's been all a big mistake, that I miss being together and having our days the way they were. I know she really tried her best in the last months and she was talking about all the things we should be doing and planning our future.\\n\\nI wish there would be an easy way to be happy again, I guess it will take a really long time. Now I just feel a big pain in my chest constantly and can't sleep properly since then.\",\n",

You all know how it is. \\n\\nI've attempted suicide once when I was 11 or 12..thought 9 1500mg Tylenol would do the trick 🙄 I felt like a prisoner in my own head and at home. I got tired of the pain and mental abuse and took them. Literally nothing happened. \\n\\nI confided in a friend at school about it because I always had thoughts of doing it again. The school counselor was called about it, so I was in her office. She had already called my parents about it. I talked to her about why I did it and what I thought would happen.\\n\\nWhen I got home that day, my mother sat on her bed crying her eyes out asking why I would try to do anything like that. I told her exactly what was going on with the mental abuse from home on top of school bullying and how years of that can get in your head and something just snaps in your head where you start to believe it. The daily hurt and not wanting or having the energy to leave your bed.  She promised to get me help and that things would change.\\n\\nNothing ever changed. Life at home steadily got worse and worse, but I never fully attempted to end my life again. The thought was always there, even on a good day. Always lurking around the corner to strike you down. \\n\\nI've been a frequent visitor in the school counselor's office since that day, I wasn't offered actual help, but I also didn't want my mother being in legal trouble for someone else's actions either. After a while, I just figured if I've survived this long without being medicated or having a therapist, why bother someone about it now? \\n\\nI deal with it by isolating myself when it gets too bad. I put myself on autopilot in a cycle. I force myself to eat, try to shower, I still sleep too long, I go to work, come home and do it all again. For months on end. When I finally get pulled from the fog of it all again, my friends question me, not understanding how I could lose track of time. Mistaking months for weeks. \\n\\nNow they're sort of used to it. I deal with it on my own. I do own a gun and an assortment of knives, but I don't plan on doing anything to bring myself harm, and they know that. Obviously they call/text from time to time to check on me\\n\\nA lot of the music put out by the rock genre has helped me over the years.

Some have support and people they can reach out to for support but some of us don't or just don't want to feel like a burden to our families, which is why a lot of us are here. \\n\\nThe whole point of this post wasn't to bring anyone down, but to show that no one is alone in this scattered mess. We all have demons inside pulling at us, trying to break us, but we're still here! There's usually something or someone keeping us here and sane  for the most part.\\n\\nI've always turned to strangers on the internet to vent, talk, whatever when I felt like getting everything off my chest to try to ease my mind and thoughts, and ended up making some really good friends along the way. \\n\\nI just wanted to let you all know that if you EVER need someone to reach out to for support to keep going, I am here for you guys. I'll listen, I'll care, and I'll do everything in my power to help the best I can. \\n\\nI work nights during the week, so if you can't sleep, I'm your man. I've got SC and FB as well if you need me on there too. Whatever you need, I'm there. Trying to help others out of the pit has always helped me stay out of mine and it took a kick in the ass for me to remember that. \\n\\nI'm sorry for it being so long, but hold on, and keep your head held high.

I currently attend park center senior high school... \\n    I\\'m here to tell my story and hopefully get some insight into my life and hear your opinions. \\n    \\tLast year I confessed to my parents that I think I have anxiety. I realized this while doing some research on how I feel living life over the 2018 summer. even then I wasn\\'t sure but I figured she should know because it would start affecting,y daily life. I would always have a high heart rate even know I\\'m a runner.\\n    \\tWhen I went in for my doctor\\'s appointment I took that GAD (general anxiety disorder) she later came back and basically said I have severe anxiety with a mild depressive episode. She started me on 20mg of Fluoxetine, the normal starting dose for kids. So after a while, I noticed that these meds were effecting me differently, my friends were asking if I was okay because they say \"I seem different\". I didn\\'t feel different at the time but I thought about it for the next few days. I noticed I was ALWAYS tired. I was never motivated to do anything. I would be the guy to watch my friends do something really fun and be happy for them, but I would be in the corner.\\n    \\tSo I started taking double my dose after I researched if my body could handle it. (max dose of fluoxetine is 80mg). so I was taking 40mg of fluoxetine per day) now the doc told me it might cause some tiredness so I always took it at night. after a little while of 40mg, I was still fucked up. I was getting more and more depressed and less and less anxiety. I was getting suicidal and had my phase with self-harm. \\n    \\tSo recently (maybe a month or 2) ago I asked my mom to make a 2nd appointment for my mental health. after conversing with my doctor about how I feel and telling her I\\'ve been taking double the dose, she said that we were gonna keep my dose off fluoxetine with 40mg per day to control the anxiety, and introduce a small dose of Wellbutrin to help with the depression. now Wellbutrin was supposed to perk me up a little and not be tired, so I had high hopes.\\n    \\tAfter a little while on these new drugs (again, month or so) I notice that I am experiencing terrible anxiety when I\\'m at school and as soon as I get home, I\\'m fine for like an hour then I just get incredibly depressed. it\\'s been bad. \\n    \\tI\\'ve tried to keep my head up and not fall back down so I\\'ve researched \"safer\" ways to cause my body harm and still get the pain I need. things like snapping a rubber band on my wrist to the point where it is red and swells up, and also sticking ice on my wrist and leaving it there, this causes pain to the arm and can \"burn\". (yes, an ice burn is a thing). \\n    \\tI\\'ve just been really pissed with the school system lately too because they really teach us the least important shit that we will never use. like yeah, i get they are teaching us to learn but teach us with the important stuff. like I\\'m mature enough, I can learn about taxes and mortgages and stuff. I need that extra challenge to keep me busy, but with my anxiety, my grades do not represent my smarts, so I stay in lower-level classes bored and depressed. I mean you might even be able to tell I\\'m smarter by the way I write this letter. I\\'m in 9th grade... cmon now.\\n    \\n    What should I do? I\\'m going to the doc in 2 weeks. what should I tell her?\\n    Thank you all, I really appreciate it.\\n    -Nick',\n",

       "  'Hi all! I just stumbled on this subreddit. I think its great for us to be able to express ourselves freely and help each other out in a forum like this. \\n\\nLately, especially the past 2 months or so, have been so rough for me mentally. I suffer from general anxiety and depression a lot, (obviously), and due to my substance abuse (specifically LSD, MDMA, and marijuana) these illnesses have been amplified to a next degree. I began to suffer from mental illness, especially social/general anxiety, at fairly young age (15-16). I was already super awkward in coversations but recently (i am 21 years old) it got worse. Due to my childhood trust issues and lack of self confidence, i began spend time with friends who curious in taking drugs, essentailly not the best influences due to my current state and this further decreased my self confidence bc i became addicted to some and used others far too frequently. Relationships with friends began to suffer because during our “trips” on LSD and even MDMA i would go into teribble thought loops of pure negativity. And no one enjoys that person on a trip. I wouldnt be able to have a conversation with someone bc of how in my head i was, and this would even lead me to not being able to help my own friends when they are having their own anxiety attacks bc i would know what to do. I would be stuck in a mode of panic and terror. My friends do not take this lightly and i know this. I feel selfish and gross for not being able to be there to help them bc of my own condition. I continued to try to get myself out but always found a way to give up getting out of the thought loop bc it was so difficult and my brain would race a million miles a minute. After continued uses of these substances over a span of 2-3 years, my depression and anxiety increased, ultimately bc of the psycological torture i would put myself through with these thoughts loops and anxiety attacks i would get. I would come to the most radical conclusions about myself, essentially going too deep down the rabbit hole. During an LSD trip i dove down into a deep rabbit hole of exsistential terror and depression in which I came to my ultimate low. My rabbit hole dove so deep that i questioned my own sexuality bc i thought a woman would never want to be with a piece of shit like me and that there is no hope. This led to my ultimate demise bc this questioning of my own being led me to become more socially awkward/anti social...to the point of not trusting my friends anymore and becoming very internally dominated when out in public/social environments and it has made conversations and interactions the most difficult it has ever been, even with close family. My friends began to tell me that maybe i am gay/bisexual bc of that conclusion i went to. But this never sat well with me and never felt right in my gut bc i have been straight all my life and have had girlfriends and sexual relationships as well. I was always socially awkward. I knew this conclusion arose due to my lack of self confidence and depression/anxiety making me draw the most radical conclusion. I began to build jelously and resent in myself bc of my lack of self confidence, anxiety and drug abuse. I always find myself overthinking, and analyzing everything. My friends have noticed this and have started treating me differently due to my vulnerability, such as not paying me back money they owed me for a while, treating/indirectly calling me stupid and childlike for what i have done (such as not being there during their anxiety attacks and general negative thinking) , etc.  \\n\\nSo this is my current condition. Heavily anxious, anti-social, and even more socially awkward. I find that i judge myself/others a lot, so i can start there by stopping the judging by simply being more observant and listening more than being interally dominated bc i know that creates negative patterns. However, a huge demon i am still fighting is the hormone monster, to put it in the most simplist of terms. Because of that one LSD trip when i questioned my sexuality bc of hopelessness, my anxious mind has not shut that door yet, mostly bc i have been in a dry spell with woman for quite some time now and my testosterone is high, essentially the darker side of my mind opens doors to “every sexual oppurtunity” even though i favor women.  It is just that i have not had much experience with women and i always get really nervous when talking to them... maybe i have to try and not sexualize them as much and just have normal conversation.This drives me to have immense social anxiety with both men and women and leads me to eventually isolate myself from all interactions, including with friends and family. Thank you for reading this whoever you are! You are a champ! And any advice/thoughts are appreciated. Love you all!\\n\\nEDIT: my friends also indirectly hint at me that i DONT want things to be better, and that i am a “cancer”.  They always say shit that has double meaning and they laugh amongst themselves about it while they watch me overthink and ruminate after what they say. They call it “high talk” bc everything they say during this “high talk” involves someone getting brain cancer or being stupid/ill and they always look at me when they say this shit and laugh together when i overthink it. I always think its bc of something ive done which made them say this stuff.  I can somewhat understand bc of what i mentioned earlier about our drug trips and me sometimes not being to help them through anxiety attacks bc i was having my own anxiety attack. Makes me feel very alone and isolated, even by family bc they know of my drug use and i feel have somehwat disowned me bc of it.',\n",

Without my knowledge or consent, the mods deleted the posts almost a year after I first posted them and several months after I reposted them. Their reasoning was inane- even though the posts had been up a year and had more than 2000 upvotes and countless comments on how helpful the links were, the mods apparently decided they couldn\\'t condone a \"random\\' list of links they personally didn\\'t vet. Since that time, I\\'ve been receiving non-stop private messages looking for the posts and if I can send the links. But the mods here at /r/depressed have been grateful enough to allow me to repost these lists and hopefully they will find their way to those who need them even though this is a small subreddit. \\n\\nA quick overview on myself, I am a 34 year old and was diagnosed with depression at a very early age. I have been on medication non-stop for 22 years and will continue to be on it the rest of my life most likely. Even though I am on medication, and without it I would lose my mind, I have been on more medications and combinations of medications than I can count and am considered treatment resistant because I\\'ve never fully responded to any treatment. I am considered to have what is called double depression, which means I go from dysthymia to varying degrees in severity of major depression- which means I don\\'t get breaks between episodes. I have numerous other symptoms that developed from long term depression, which means each and every day is a battle against both my mind *and* my body. I’m not sure there’s much I haven’t tried- years of talk therapy, sports and exercise, yoga, hypnotherapy, acupuncture, massage, diet change, travelling around the world, jumping out of planes… the list goes on. I have checked into programs at psychiatric hospitals, have been through rounds of ECT without change, and was part of a specialized TMS study that fully maps my brain in order to pinpoint a consistent spot within a few millimeters. During this study, I had consistent PET and MEG scans to note the effects (or lack of) during the trial to give the doctors an objective documentation, rather than just my subjective reporting of how I feel, of the effects on my brain. In trial reports, I am referred to as the non-responder. Depression is visible on my brain scans as easily as a broken arm is on an x-ray. \\n\\nBut all that I have said about depression and how I’ve attempted to treat it is applicable only to me. What has or hasn’t worked for me, what caused side effects and what caused no effects, are in no way indicative of how they will affect anyone else. And the depression itself presents in many forms, even within one person. \\nI do believe for some people it is a disease while for others it is a condition. Also I think the spectrum of severity is so vast that it does both the sufferers and the societal stigma a great disservice to have a single word that someone uses when they are having a bad hair day to the diagnosis given to someone in a vegetative, non-functioning state looking for death to come. I liken it to the lung condition spectrum. On one end you have the sniffles, then the cold, the flu, bronchitis, pneumonia, emphysema, and end stage lung cancer on the far end. Only you can only use the word \"the flu\" to describe every one of these conditions. So you have both sufferers and non-sufferers alike telling people at the end stage lung cancer part of the spectrum that if they just pop a few echinacea and get some rest, they\\'ll be feeling fine in a day or two. No one flippantly says, \"I\\'m feeling a little diabetic today,\" or \"I think I\\'m going into an episode of leukemia from all the stress lately in my life\" - this is why even those that have suffered from depression help perpetrate the stigma because they judge others based on what treatment helped them in their specific state or however they specifically felt or how long it took them to get over it. If I hear I\\'ll be helped by yoga and meditation one more time...\\n\\nFor most people, depression is treatable, but there is no instant fix or single miracle cure. Be your own advocate in your treatment and follow any path that you think may help bring you relief. I realize it\\'s hard to fight to reclaim your life against a disease controlling your mind and saying you\\'d be better off dead, but this is why those who battle depression are the strongest people you\\'ll ever meet. We don\\'t have people bringing us casseroles, sending us get well cards, co-workers offering to fill in extra hours, people posting facebook messages about how they are praying for us, no one calling to check in on us, or often don\\'t even have the luxury of publicly naming our disease without fear of backlash and shaming and judgment.  But we do it- we continue to live each day running on empty, bound and chained down by what Professor Robert Sapolsky calls, \"the worst disease you can get\" and what renowned psychiatrist Peter Kramer believes is the \"most devastating disease known to mankind.\" And those who don\\'t make it through another day, they didn\\'t give up- they simply lost the battle to a powerful enemy. \\n\\nDepression fucking sucks. Fear of death is not nearly as scary as fear of living another day. But how do we see most diagnosed with serious illnesses? Rotten luck. There is no shame in suffering the illness of depression. It’s just rotten fucking luck. \\n\\nI will be periodically updating and adding more links as I come across additional helpful information.

In this month\\'s edition, they have a section on depression. To quote them, \"depression is a medical problem, like having diabetes or needing eyeglasses. It is nothing to be ashamed of...\" Yet their policy won\\'t cover any hospitalization or in-patient treatment facility for mental health issues. Also, there is a set limit on psychiatry visits and no coverage for therapy visits (even though this flyer points out how crucial therapy is for recovery). So no, they do not treat mental health like diabetes, and certainly don\\'t treat it like a medical issue requiring medical treatment. The kicker is the section is with a picture of smiling doctor in a lab coat with a stethoscope saying he\\'s here to help- yet he is a medical doctor in a hospital or medical facility, not a psychiatrist (just a guess given the lab coat and stethoscope)- the exact people this insurance policy gives absolutely no coverage to see.\\n***\\nsuicide:\\n[Night Falls Fast](http://www.amazon.com/Night-Falls-Fast-Understanding-Suicide/dp/0375701478)\\n\\nfrom the r/suicidewatch mods: \\n\\n[proven strategies for helping someone at risk:](http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/igh87/concerned_but_dont_know_what_to_say_here_are_some/)\\n\\n[Worried about someone who may be suicidal?

Also unlike the almost instant effects of speed, the mood-improving effects of antidepressants develop slowly over a number of weeks. “Speed” induces a highly artificial state, antidepressants cause the brain to slowly increase its production of naturally occurring neurotransmitters.\\n***\\n[PART 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/3d6gaa/my_massive_list_of_depression_resources_part_2/)',\n",

She’s not wrong of course. But what I don’t know how to explain to her is how I truly feel about it all. When people are dying of terminal diseases, there’s an option to pull to the plug, to stop their suffering instead of gambling on the one in a million chance they’ll pull through. Why can’t people think about depression and suicide the same way? If the emotional pain is so visceral that people kill them selves to stop it, shouldn’t it be a valid school of thought? Therapy and medication are the life support and depression is the terminal cancer. Some people spend years switching meds and seeing professionals, and struggling everyday. If we give terminally ill patients an out when things aren’t working, why can’t depressed people have the same? How long are people expected to suffer? How long must a person torment themselves all because their family or society says they shouldn’t give up? I should be able to pull the plug if my suffering is too much to bare.

Her and I were talking very often, hanging out every day, and seeing movies and stuff as friends. I was genuinely happy with her and just be with and around her, no sexual stuff required. \\n\\nA few months after we started, it got around that we were friends and hanging out. A conniving bitch, lets call her Lucia, who was madly obsessed over me for some reason, decided to start harassing Melina. She would come up to her in between classes and just plain insult her, she would call her “whore” on Facebook, it was some really toxic stuff. After a little time of that, Melina told me she was getting depressed and feeling all kinds of sad stuff because of it and that people weren’t talking to her anymore. \\n\\nI made the executive decision to make a deal with Lucia that I would stop talking to Melina if she would cut the shit, to which she happily agreed. So that was that. I stopped talking and hanging out with her and she wasn’t harassed anymore, the posts were taken down, etc. But the one thing that was making me happy was now gone because I’m a stupid, honor-bound idiot who thinks that promises are more important than being happy. \\n\\nThis was 3 years ago.

SOMETHING.... \\\\[What I did get is a class D felony, and a sex offense.. so my future job hunt has been absolute shit... making friends is next to impossible... yet alone finding a partner... people make fun of me... call me every name in the book... the only people I have are my parents, and my little brother...\\\\] I took a plea bargain that promised me no prison time... but a hefty probation sentence... I lost my job, dropped out of school... been THREATENED... YES THREATENED... at this point I just wish they would just kill me...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSkip forward a year... at this point I started counselling and they prescribed me Cymbalta.. \\\\[an anti-depressant\\\\] because I was constantly crying.. I didn\\'t want to do shit... I hated everything there is to hate... I never left home... mom cried I was depressed... So I tried to overdose... It failed miserably and I got admitted into the psych hospital against my will... it was awful... then that November the house i\\'m living in caught fire and burned to the ground and I lost EVERYTHING... all my notes... my childhood collections... everything that meant anything to me.... electrical fire.... I still resent that day, and it was a year ago. Well that brings me to where I am now... and my current complaint\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAll of the past... all of my resentment leads me to this moment... and the moment to where I feel like I can not continue... I want to die... I hate life, I hate everything there is to hate about everything... people disgust me... it\\'s only in moments of desperation that we find out what animals we truly are\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLast year, I started a relationshit (mhm) with what is now my fiancee. We were going strong at the beginning, and now it\\'s meh. All we do is argue, but i\\'ll get to that in a moment... 2 months ago we decided to have a child.. and now she is pregnant. mostly because of her LYING to me about being pregnant before then having a serious argument when I would use a condom since \"she\\'s already pregnant\" petty I know but i thought (Well, she just wants to have a baby, so she must be happy. I had already asked her to marry me and our wedding is planned so why the hell not?) One month after that February of this year.. (4 months ago) my mama and little brother (18) were killed in an accident.. two of the closest people in my life and gone... I WANT TO GO TOO!!! I cried... dealing with two different funerals in two weeks.... now I hate everyone... I didn\\'t want to be intimate for a while after the accident, with my fiancee... I cry constantly... I can\\'t talk to her because she has ABSOLUTELY NO empathy for anything I go through... but we will get there in a moment.. Where do I go???? Depression forums with people online WHO DON\\'T KNOW ME BRING ME MORE SUPPORT THAN HER?? Reddit?? I don\\'t know what I need... Everything is shit... my life  SUCKS... I want to die man... i just want to fucking die...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOn forward to our relationshit... Because of MY position it is hard for me to get a job... She has a job making 15 an hour.. bringing in about 1500 a month or so... My older brother lets me work for him on the weekends and I bring in about 800 a month... That\\'s it I pay the rent and the utilities and my check is gone... and she constantly tells me i\\'m lazy when she has WATCHED me fill out multiple applications for jobs... and knows my position... some jobs have even fired me after finding about my job because I have to tell them... regardless... she hates where we live... constantly blames me for every shit thing in HER life.. yet alone mine... yells at me... swears at me... literally degrades me and runs me into the ground.... tells me she\\'s unhappy and wants the leave, don\\'t even want a wedding at this point.... But I don\\'t want to leave her... she has no empathy... I do everything for her in my power for her, but she does not return because she\\'s an entitled brat and \"money is a stresser\" I grew up fucking poor, but I had food on the table and a place to live... I didn\\'t have NICE elegant lifestyle she had... she got everything she wanted when I had to make do... nothing is enough for her... She had a rough past I get that.. but damn that doesn\\'t mean she has the right to treat me like shit... every time we go out she fucking passive aggessive comments \"well we could buy that if my husband had a job, and wasn\\'t so lazy\" or... \"I hate having to buy everything I wish someone had a JOB\" I tell her to budget her money better \"I have no right\" motherfu- ...... and that\\'s just the tip of the iceburg... my dad called her on her shit and she got mad because \"I didn\\'t stand up for her\"\\n\\n\"Are you going to take the car son, or is that going to piss her off like everything else does\" My childhood friend was over at the house one day and felt awkward because all we did was fight.. he says something and now \"all my family hates her\" because of the way she treats me... TREAT ME BETTER... GO AROUND THEM AND STOP ACTING LIKE A STUCK UP PRICK... this leads me to my final point....\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m about to be done with her... but once again, because of my charge she will more than likely end up with full custody of our child.... so she and the baby will be gone... our baby.. THE ONLY THING IN THIS FUCKING WORLD THAT COULD MAKE ME FEEL BETTER... ....... all because I groped a teenager on the ass I\\'ve lost everything... I have nothing left... only my father who is deteriorating in health.. by the way my fiancee tells me \"I\\'m more concerned being a son than a husband\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR; Got a sexual assualt charge because I was fucked up at a party, had a house burn down, lost everything... lost my mother and little brother (18) in a car accident... now going to loose my fiancee and my child because i\\'m a fucking looser... want to die already',\n",

       "  'Hello, hope you are all doing well. This is actually my first post on Reddit. I\\'ve always come to reddit when ever I\\'ve needed some advice on a topic, and recently I\\'ve been using Reddit for help/advice on how I\\'m feeling (the title). I found so many of your answers to be helpful and some of them made me feel happier even if they weren\\'t directed at me. I don\\'t actually expect a response from this, I just felt like a place to write all of it down.\\n\\nI\\'ll try to keep this short (no promises). I haven\\'t actually been medically diagnosed with depression, but from just searching up the symptoms and doing online research it sure does seem like it. I\\'m usually (or at least was) a very happy, outgoing, positive person. People have said that I\\'m one of the nicest people that they\\'ve ever met. One friend literally told me that she had been having a bad day and the moment I walked into the room it was like I was radiating happy energy; which made her feel better. Making people laugh, smile, and happy in general always made me feel better. I\\'m still this person, but a lot of the time I feel as though this person is ceasing to exist. It\\'s getting harder and harder to stay happy, and to be outgoing; and I don\\'t know why. Sometimes I think \"It\\'s one of those things where the happiest person on the outside is the saddest on the inside.\"\\n\\nI\\'ve been getting more and more insecure about everything. I used to always overthink, but now I find myself overthinking about everything: \"Am I being weird?\" \"Do my friends actually like me?\". It\\'s even with people on the street: \"That person just looked at me, is there something wrong with me?\". Normally I would talk to my friends (who I love dearly), but again with the overthinking: \"They don\\'t want to hear any of this.\" \"They\\'ve got better things to do than to hear my problems.\" I do understand that they are here for me, but all that physically will stop me from talking to them.\\n\\nFamily is the same, I can\\'t really talk to them about this either. I\\'m worried that all of this will scare and worry them, which again stops me from telling them. When I was 13 ish, my dad had a huge fight with my step mum because of me (I won\\'t get into that because that would make this post way longer than it already is). They would fight a lot, and a lot of the fights were because of me. Anyways, after this fight in particular I went out onto our balcony and climbed over the railing and onto the edge (which was just wide enough for me to stand on). It was there, with my toes hanging off the edge, that I looked straight down 31 floors and thought of jumping. Well, I didn\\'t and I told my dad straight after and he told me to never tell him anything like that again because it scared the shit out of him. Hence my fear of telling my family about my thoughts, I suppose.\\n\\nWoah okay this post is already getting reaaaalllly long. There\\'s so much shit that I can continue going on about, but I\\'ll do a summary (never ever been good at those). Aside from the overthinking and the whole \"I used to be a happy person\" thing, feeling lonely is something that eats away at me everyday. I\\'ve been single for 2 years, and during those two years I have not had sex. A lot of my friends are in the cutest relationships with the best people, and as happy as I am for them, (I feel horrible saying this) but I\\'m also quite jealous (probably another reason why I can\\'t talk to my friends as I can\\'t tell them this). It\\'s been harder and harder to meet new people, especially with me feeling like I am not as outgoing and chirpy as before. And the longer it takes, the harder it gets.\\n\\nThis all then sort of combines into this feeling of worthlessness and how everything is pointless. I\\'m 20 and I have a full time 9-5 office job as a graphic designer. And every day I have a thought somewhere along the lines of \"Is this all worth it?\" \"Where am I going in life?\" \"What\\'s the whole fucking point?\". I think of suicide from time to time, but I will never do it because I don\\'t want to inflict any sadness and hurt on to my friends or family. However I\\'m worried that the longer it gets the more likely I am to do so.\\n\\nI don\\'t really know where I\\'m going with this post anymore. I started out with something to say but now it\\'s all become paragraphs of randomness. I guess it\\'s just how I\\'ve been feeling and possible reasons to why I\\'m feeling so? One of the things that I want to do is fix this, and not let it scare me anymore.',\n",
       "  'So... here I come to the depressed subreddit to tell my story. Well where do I start?\\n\\n Like in the title I am 34yrs old, 5\\'2\", 350lbs, I still live with my parents, I\\'ve never had a job, I don\\'t have my drivers license, I\\'ve never had a girlfriend nor have I been in a relationship with a girl my entire life, and I\\'m a virgin to add on top of all of that. The reason I still live with my parents is I suffer from high anxiety and depression which makes it really hard for me to socialize with people. That\\'s also another thing I forgot to add is I am very anti-social. I will admit I did have one job, but it only lasted a few days because it was a job at the mall at one of the kiosks and I ended up having a panic attack.\\n\\n Yes I do take medication for my depression but it only last for a little while. I\\'ve never had a relationship with a girl my entire life because I\\'m shy and of course anti-social. Also I was home schooled so I never interacted with actual students. I\\'ve been wanting to go out with a girl for a long time but I just can\\'t seem to find the right person to ask. I\\'ve tried online dating but that doesn\\'t seem to work. \\n\\nAlso I am a virgin so I\\'ve never had sex before and yes I\\'m one of those guys who is like always horny so I just deal with it like everyone else does which is masturbating. I know that\\'s a lovely thing to tell people on here but hey I\\'ve seen worse things told on Reddit lol. I\\'ve also moved a lot and I now live in Houston TX for 19yrs now. I\\'m mostly a homebody and lay in bed most of the day doing things on my computer. I\\'m more social online then in real life. \\n\\nI do get out of the house sometimes when one of my parents have to go out and run errands. I enjoy collecting things like Transformers, Hot Toys figures, and Funko POPs. I do get money from my father twice a month so I guess that\\'s where my income comes from. I know its not the best way to get money, but my father offers it to me so I take what I can get. \\n\\nHe gives it to me as I help do things around the house and I help my mother out as she suffers from fibromyalgia and can\\'t left heavy stuff. I try to save my money, but I just spend it on stuff I like to collect which I have too much of right now. I had to move to one of the other rooms in our house when we had our floors cleaned and my grandma is staying with us for six weeks until her place is ready to move into. So I had to pack my stuff and its all stacked up in my father\\'s office room.\\n\\n I\\'ve been meaning to start moving some of it back into my room but I just can\\'t seem to get myself to do it. I pretty much procrastinate a lot. I would like to make some friends on here and talk to people who are in the same position I\\'m in. I also get pretty lonely that sometimes I\\'ll talk to myself which oddly enough I do a lot when I\\'m out of the house. \\n\\nI forgot to mention why I haven\\'t gotten a drivers license well I guess I\\'m just afraid to do it and having to do the driving part with someone in the car with you makes my anxiety really high. So that pretty much covers most of my depressing life story. I guess I\\'m posting this on here so I can just get some input on what I should do to make changes in my life.',\n",

Not an native english speaker.\\n\\nWe met at a time where I was really depressed. A time I was really not hoping I would ever meet a person that could change my life. Oh I was so wrong...\\n\\nI am going to refer to her as just ***M***\\n\\nWe were 17, 3th year in our high-school. Interestingly enough, the first time we ever saw each other was on my birth day. She of course didn\\'t know at the time that it was my birth day. The first time I saw her I made her smile. I didn\\'t try, nor did I say something. I tend to make people laugh or smile when they are around me, but I don\\'t consider my self as a funny guy. We have a same friend so she would come often to our part of the school where our class room was so she can talk to him. Me and my friend were in the same class, she wasn\\'t. The first time we officially met was at our friend birth day, some days after mine. We were both happy we finally met each other. We days gone by and our school organised an excursion (had to google the word..) to Prague and Vienna for a couple of days. My friends, she and I were going. I was really exited. I remember those couple of days as being the best days of my life, up until the last day (will explain why). Those are...or were...my favorite cities in europe and going there with the people I truly cherish was mind blowing for me. Even now as I wright this I can\\'t but find a huge Joker smile on my face. We walked, talked, made each other laugh, and we were getting to know each other in those beautiful Prague streets. We even hanged at my room in the hotel which I shared with some friend (a school organised thing, need I remind you) over night. My fondest memory was walking over Karl\\'s bridge, not even looking around or being aware I was walking over that amazing bridge because I was walking with her, talking about her. We were both so deeply involved in our conversations that we didn\\'t really cared that much where we were, or were are we going.\\n\\nI can\\'t speak on her behalf but I can tell time stopped for the both of us.\\n\\nThe last day which was in Vienna was really difficult for me because one of my childhood friends committed suicide back home, and all i got was a text and a hand written letter waiting for me back home. I was paralyzed but even at that difficult time I was semi-okay because ***M*** was right there. She noticed that I wasn\\'t okey, one of meny times she will notice that I was not okey... We talked in the bus as we were going home. I wish i could go back in time just so I can see us walking over that bridge...\\n\\nDays and moths passed and our friendship only grew bigger, but so was my depression. Depressed not because of my childhood friend ( well yes but that\\'s not the true cause of my inner pain), but another female friend who basically gave a introverted boy a new life. Life separated us, we never saw each other, we changed but I was after all those years still in love with that girl, hoping life will bring her back...and than came ***M***...\\n\\n***M*** was starting to be like a drug for me, I couldn\\'t eat, sleep, think properly. I wanted to go to school just so we can talk and laugh together. And so, slowly but surely I was falling in love with here even tho i didn\\'t want that, because I knew I would be having love problems, or any problems for that matter because I know I\\'m unfit to be in a relationship in that state. I had too much respect for her, and even if she wanted a relationship with me I would make here change her mind. This was the problem that only grew over the years which will later in life try to kill me...\\n\\nI prayed to God for not making me fall in love with her just so I could avoid...this. As you can see, he didn\\'t answer.\\n\\nIn our 4th and our last year in our high-school ***M***( which became my bestfriend), my \"friends\" and me wanted to go to the same college. Oh and why \"\" on \\'\\'friend\" you might ask? One of my best friends notices I was getting mentally worse and worse because of school stress, love, and collage application test. He noticed but was not willing to help me, so he literally turned other people backs on me by saying I was a freak, an idiot, a psyco..etc. Basically I went from around 20 friends to 3. ***M*** and our same friend from the beginning of this entry were two of my three friends who didn\\'t want to listen nor believe in those lies. I was so broken, so damaged...self hatred grew by the day to the point I was planing my own suicide by hanging. I was so serious I was reading some forums on how to do it effectively  and the dangers of surviving a hanging. At the time I was really scared of my self. Lost a lot of friends, I was doing terrible in school to the point I knew I was going to fail, and if I fail I will not get the right documents with which I can apply for the college application test. If I don\\'t pass the grade, I don\\'t get the papers, if I don\\'t get the papers I cant apply, if I don\\'y apply ***M*** will apply and will get accepted with out me and ultimately...I won\\'t be seeing her...\\n\\nI was 100% sure I was going to fail and was thinking about suicide a lot. The only time I was not thinking about that was when I looked at her. We didn\\'t even need to talk, I could just look at the across the hall and everything would be ok. If it wasn\\'t for her at that time I would not be writing this and you would be reading or doing something else. The thing that bothered me was I was, and still am deeply in love with here but knowing that I am not capable for a relationship or even knowing I wasn\\'t the right for her is still killing me inside, and I can\\'t stop it...it hadn\\'t stop for years... \\n\\nIt\\'s like she knew I was wanting to kill my self so she would randomly walk towards me and we would just talk like nothing bad was ever happening in my rotting mind. She knew but didn\\'t knew the scale of my pain. It\\'s like God made her walk towards me just so I can live for another week or so. Maybe it was just a coincidence...make of it as you wish. At the time I knew these were our last days together so I cherished every second of our conversations. I was aware of the quote \"cherish before it\\'s too late\\'\\' so I did just that, and even tho it was two years ago I can still vividly remember those sweet and cute moments. I knew these were our last days together so I wanted to tell her that I deeply love her. (Starting to cry again...) I knew I couldn\\'t look her in those blue-marbel eyes and tell her that, I was too scared of the reaction. She was not my bestfriend but something more...but I knew I couldn\\'t have more, only less. I was counting our last days, and every day was worse and worse. \\n\\nShe got accepted, and I faild...\\n\\nThe summer break began and we saw each other one time of the three or four months of free time... But even tho we went out I will cherish that day till my last day. I tried, not only thru the summer but even when we went to school, I tried going out with her to the movies, coffee, shakes...etc nothing except that one beautiful day.  I cant say if she didn\\'t want to go with me or she really couldn\\'t. Needless to say she is a super hot and bright girl, and I\\'m an over weight peace of shit that likes to help every single soul on this planet even tho some don\\'t deserve it cause I love helping people but most of all I looove making people smile, and thank God that\\'s a natural thing for me because I just turn off my brain when I\\'m talking to people, only motor skill needed to make people laugh it seems... She was at the time the only person in my life that didn\\'t see me as I saw my self, and that blew me away. Some can say that\\'s the real reason I love her...Does anybody need a reason to love a person? \\n\\nThe last time we saw each other was at the first day of collage, 1st of October last year. On that day I gave her a birth day gift even tho her birth day was tomorrow. I know I won\\'t be seeing her after that day so I gave her on that day. It was really emotional for me, because It was not just a birth day gift, which was a signed marvel Star Boy comic-book and it was signed ofc by The Weeknd (bragging a little) but my \\'\\'thank you, good bye and I love you\\'\\'. I told her to open it tomorrow when she gets back home after collage. I told her to open it tomorrow so I could unfollow her on instagram, remove her from facebook, and even...delete our texts. I was basically ripping her out of my world like a fresh bandage on a fresh open wound. Why? I was so in love that I wanted to protect her from the most  destructive person that she knows...Me. She found a way to thank me with a message but that was it.\\n\\nThat was the last time we would ever speak to each other...it\\'s been little over a year and we still don\\'t talk...\\n\\nI managed to finish school, went on some preparations for the same college...again (went the first time when I was in the 4th year of HS), met a lot of new people there and managed to stay in touch with my two friends from HS.\\n\\nOver the year I did something I really wished I didn\\'t done but I just couldn\\'t keep it together...I stalked her on instagram with a random account. I feel so mad at my self and sometimes I\\'m even sick because I know I shouldn\\'t be doing that but I miss her so fucking much that some times I can\\'t even sleep because I spent my nights thinking about her, remembering our funny little moments, and even writing (I have a journal for my mental problems and it really helped me) about these thing that keep me locked, sick and depressed. I didn\\'t check her profile every single day (not that mad), just periodically just because I really miss her smile sometimes, or I\\'m just wondering is she ok, is everything okay in her life, how is she? If stalking for that reason is a crime than lock me up. I get worried and paranoid (especially when I come back home after drinking) but at the end, I know that i don\\'t need to worry...she is always, 24/7 surrounded by the people who love her and that she loves. I would be just a number in that pool of people that adore her. I would not make a difference.\\n\\nIt hurts like hell because she took that good bye like it\\'s just a normal, every day \\'\\'bye\\'\\' but it\\'s not. I can\\'t look at her in a \\'\\'best friend\\'\\' manner, she is just so much more. But I get the felling that I don\\'t matter to her...at all. She texted me that she got in, a sign that she really wanted to me to know that she got accepted at our dream college, if I didn\\'t matter she wouldn\\'t text me. It\\'s like she took that way to easily than me, like she wanted me to leave her the fuck alone... maybe I\\'m just paranoid and mad at my self and not willing seeing the truth, that she did hurt, but I just didn\\'t see it...\\n\\nWe texted but nothing much. Just some few stupid texts. I wrote to her because the silence was too much for me on Viber even tho I knew she didn\\'t open it in a while. Our main way of communication is via watsapp, because I don\\'t have the balls to delete her phone number. I deleted it so meany times I know it by heart. \\n\\nA year passed and I too got accepted. My ***M*** is now ...m...\\n\\nWe both changed. I tried finding my self, and tried loving my self just a bit more. Learned drawing, and learned a lot about history, art and other stuff over the year. Grown my hair even. She too changed, not my looks, but...i don\\'t know... I am not the person she remembers and she Is not the girl that saved my life. We see each other with the corner of our eyes, but we don\\'t talk, we just pass by each other and it\\'s fucking k-i-l-l-i-n-g me. But the most worst thing, and the thing that drove me overboard is that I saw her smoking. She isn\\'t the type of a person that you would assume that smokes. She was a dancer, the type of person that didn\\'t drink beer, didn\\'t smoke, didn\\'t do stupid shit, not even drinking coca-cola. When I saw her... it was like Thanos came and snapped me from existence. I wanted to jump off the building. I am so fucking sick, and so incredible mad at my self right now... I know I couldn\\'t to anything to help, but just the taught of me getting accepted with her and studying together could  have made a difference makes my soul wanna ripp my mind apart. I don\\'t have a problem for smoking or other stuff, i tried it all ( the legal, and easy obtainable illegal stuff) and I would not normally judge, but this threw me off the ledge. I\\'m furious at my self for not helping her like she helped me, even tho I know I shouldn\\'t be. I helped so...sooo much people because she helped me and she didn\\'t even know at the time that our little silly talks kept me alive.\\n\\nOnly one moth passed and I all ready don\\'t feel so good... I don\\'t know if God is playing a joke on me or life just likes fucking me around but this...this is too much.\\n\\nI really miss her but I know, and see that my ***M*** doesn\\'t exit anymore. A year can change a person... for better or for worse.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nZnam da najverovatnije nećeš nikad ovo videti ali nije više ni bitno. Mnogo mi nedostaješ...

       "  'In the last 4 months I’ve lost 5kgs, going from 55 to 50 kg. At my height, that’s underweight. I’ve only been losing hair but I’ve pinned that to the stress I was under during finals in June. It hasn’t gotten better so I was wondering if it was something physically wrong with me and been thinking of going to the doctor to the my blood tested or something. \\n\\nBut I’ve been feeling down a lot lately. Kinda emotionally unstable. It takes very little to send me down a spiral where I feel like life isn’t worth it anymore.

I can’t and i don’t want to like anyone else cause i want him to start to really like me again. I have been going through so much pain and i don’t know what to say to him. We use to facetime every single day. Talk all day and almost all night.  Now i tried to facetime him today but he said he didn’t want to. \\n\\nI don’t know what i did and how he started to not like me anymore but i god damn wanna die. He made me feel good about myself all the time. He called me Beautiful, he called me gorgeous and he always said he loved me. Everyday. Just life is impossible now....i just wanna say something to him. Everyone finds him ugly but idk how. I find him really handsome and he always said “everyone else at school is ugly, your the only pretty one.” He also said “I’m never gonna stop loving you. your the only person who i love to be around. If we ever break up i’m gonna kill myself.” When we got 2gether i said “aren’t we to young? I don’t wanna destroy our friendship.” he said “So what if we’re to young? And whose gonna be the one to break up? i don’t think our friendship is gonna end.” I guess he lied. I have no clue what to do now. Idk what to say to him. All i wish for in life is for him to like me again and for us to get married and have the most amazing life. That’s what we said we would have.. i just want it to come back. He was my first everything.  we agreed to be friends again but we’re far away from what we were. i don’t wanna loose him by saying the wrong thing. What do you think i should say to him? i’ve tried a lot of things but nothing is working...',\n",

       "  \"There are 2 different kinds of support a depressed person needs. These can come from one or two different people. Those people can't be depressed themselves otherwise it defeats the purpose of them being there. It can be a person who has gone through depression and is now over it.\\n\\nThe first type of support is the logical support. This support helps you find things to do that are logical and helps you do things that you do in your daily life nicely. This person acts as the bigger brain for your brain. The peraon can make your brain understand ehat can be done in a logical manner. However, just like a human body, we can either decide to accept the instructions by the bigger brain or reject them if they dont make sense.\\n\\nThe second type of support is emotional support. This support gives you warmth for your heart. For it to be rebuilt from the things it has gone through. This person can help you rebuild any trust issues you may have or any kind of emotional stress you may be going through. This support acts like a heart for your body. A heart that cares for you and your body. A heart that knows what you are thinking and what you feel about any topic that may be brought up. Its almoat like a new heart has been placed into your body and it doesn't know a thing about you as a person so you have to teach it.\\n\\nA depressed persons heart and mind are in a constant conflict. They are in a fight that no one can win. Your conscience can try to stop them but its only a matter of time they start again; and hence your body needs a new pair or heart and mind that is able to think outside the box or outside your field of view. Again, these people can  be 2 different people or just one person.\\n\\nIf you have any people you can share your deepest thoughts with and trust them completely, then maybe approach them as either one of the people. Remember that you cant decide which type of support they will offer or which body part of the two (heart or mind) they will be. It depends on their personality alone. They decide.\\n\\nIf you dont have any people or friends you can share your story with, see if you can find new people. There are a few sub reddits that are there to find new friends who can relate as they have been through thesame things as you, or can just offer you those supports. If social media is not your strong point maybe go out into the world and see if you can find someone who maybe able to help. If you are an introverted person, give social media a try.\\n\\n\\n** I am by no means a doctor, therapist or a councellor. This post is simply a personal observation that i had taken in the course of a few months. This is not in any shape or form a replacement from therapy or councelling. If needed seek councelling and therapy as they can offer professional advice. **\",\n",

I also have this feeling that says \"you do not belong here\" somekind of nostalgia for the past, and ironically everyother people i meet sooner or later says something like \"you sound/behave/look like you should have been born in the middle ages\" That\\'s not what brought me here. I know i\\'m capable of standing that (i have been standing it for the last 10 years of my life). \\nA few months ago i finally found a girl that on sight made me forgot about everything, like a huge burden just got lifted. and everything worked so fine so perfectly... at least in 90% of everything, the other 10% i was sure we can fix it with time and patience... she made me laugh hard, made feel happy and really alive, best part was according to her it was the same i was the first men she actually wanted to marry, to have sons to share a life with... and i lose her, due to several stuff (that started with me being kind of and a-hole sending some messages onf fb) and get worse whit she treating me like a piece of garbage during her thesis defense. we broke up... better said she broke up with me.\\n\\nIt hurts me harder than anything in my life (and i belive me when i say i have gotten into some really nasty falls and accidents ) i feel like i couldnt breath. In a desperate and stupid attemp to win her back: I cried, i ask a friend to please arrange a meeting, go to her home (only to return without talking to her because when i called her and she picked up i din\\'t had the courage to tell her i was nearly at her front door) I broke all my rules for her, i even call her mother to see if she can intercede for me. in the end... on a day i wen\\'t to gift her some cookies (she loves cookies) i meet her on the way to her home, we chat just a bit... she seemed happy, but it kills me see her and the eyes and not see that bright like before. i could well have been just another guy saying hi... months passed and sometimes we talk a bit, just a few text messages, to deal with it i have done a lot of excercise and meditation, i went to a psychologist... date other girls, etc. and everything \"went better\"  the pain fade away bit by bit, i still thought of her every now and then of course, but it was \"better\". \\n\\nThe last few days without a real reason she started to pop up on my mind again, maybe because we haven\\'t talk in the last month i don\\'t know finally i thought i\\'d do something, maybe invite her to go out. Yesterday i did it, ask by text how she has been and say my birthday was in three days (wich is true) and that i want to take an ice cream with her. nothing more nothing less. she told she coulnd\\'t she was busy, i still ask what day she wasn\\'t busy \"all of tehm i\\'m busy\" was the answer... it was like everything started again, i even got fever... and now i\\'m here feeling worst than before, i would have been happy (or at least have a normal life) facing my old demons, but facing them and losing her it\\'s killing me... don\\'t know what more to ad... thanks for reading me.',\n",

And for like a second they worked. It was a glimmer of hope in what has been the dark black hole abyss that is my life. I felt something that wasnt completely terrible, but it went away overnight. And you might say that glimmer of happiness is a sign of a turning point, but it\\'s not. It basically served as a reminder of how fucked up I am and how I\\'ll never feel good for a prolonged time ever.

I drop literally everything for my friends. I cancel plans to go make sure they\\'re okay, I miss things to help them with school, I spend the little money I have to get their favorite food and drinks if they\\'re injured or sick. I\\'m like a mom friend sometimes but w/e. I feel like I\\'m always nice and helpful and try to do as much as I can for my friends and when I\\'m stuck in a spiral or I want to die, I feel like I should be allowed to ask for some help.

I have no idea why i get blown off or ignored. I mean, I could guess, but that\\'s just my fucked up head saying things and itll make things worse. I am just exhausted from being there for everyone and then being alone when the worst parts of my mind take over. And I dont want sympathy for them I just would like to fucking have company so I dont do anything bad to myself that I know and they know is a real possibility and is probably going to happen if I\\'m left alone which I always am. \\n\\nI know no one wants to be around me because I\\'m depressed. I\\'m no fun and I\\'m just boring and sad all the time, but I just need help and I\\'ve tried so hard to get better at reaching out, but it\\'s all for not. I just need to come to terms that no one will be there for me ever. And I\\'m not trying to throw a pity party.

       "  'So I\\'ve been super depressed for a while now (recently getting better on my own) and I feel uncomfortable telling most people because; 1: An extended family member attempted suicide and his family (including mine) treats and views him as some sort of baby made of glass who can\\'t even walk up stairs without help. The vast majority of my nuclear and extended family have alienated any sort of capability he has for anything and he can\\'t stand it. They don\\'t see him as a human being anymore, rather a constant *risk* of some kind. I am deathly afraid of this happening to me. And 2: I don\\'t really relate to my \"friends\". They\\'re just people who don\\'t fit anywhere else, like me. So we kinda just group together like societal leftovers or something, but now new groups are forming. Groups that I *also* can\\'t relate to. So my interests are almost always shot down immediately. I opened up to these people about my struggle slightly out of desperation and they beraded me with insults and accusations of (paraphrase)\"farming for pity\" and taking advantage of them like some sort of master manipulator. Sometimes even just calling me names (although not everyone did). While they did this they kept telling me I needed help and that I *had* to listen to what they were saying or I\\'d \"end up dead\".\\n\\nThat\\'s the set-up.\\n\\nRecently they started a new group chat for one of the other guys in the group who was struggling with getting over a girl he perceived to be leading him on. Everyone flocked to him and congratulated him for being strong, but when I brought up that I was still struggling and said that I was horrified of being alienated by my family, they called me lazy, saying I \"wasn\\'t taking initiative\" to talk to someone. That made me feel extremely shitty and ashamed of why I\\'m feeling so depressed all the time; like what I\\'m going through means nothing and that I\\'m just lazy or useless.\\n\\nOn top of this, I think I\\'m slowly figuring out why I\\'ve been so depressed for so long, which happens to do with my sexuality. Funnily enough a surprising fraction of my \"friend\" group is homophobic. So that doesn\\'t help.\\n\\nMy fears of speaking about my suffering became a self-fulfilling prophecy and I wonder. Are friends supposed to be like that?

I've been through alot for only being 19 and my years before age 14 had alot of bad shit connected to it that im not 100% teady to talk about.  At 14 I finally cut contact with my drug addict father after he tried to get my siblings and I taken by the state (again) and get my step dad thrown in jail for false accusations of rape on my little sister. That alone was just a bad time. He called me the night i filed a restraining order to tell me he was going to kill himself and it was my fault, that he hoped i was happy that I caused it. Fast forward 3 months and I was told by my doctor that I have something genetically wring with the muscles and joints in my knees and they needed to do surgery. Fine whatever its just to check on things and I was fine after a week of rest. All they did was clean up scar tissue. However i had just started highschool and was in a junior ROTC program through the army. I was excited and wanted to make a difference that my POS father refused to. I loved this program it was my family and I made really good friends. I joined their shooting team and made it my goal. I got good, really good, too 10 in the nation good . My coach and instructors were ther closest thing to a father I had. I loved them and I felt safe with them. A year goes by and my surgeon tells me he was wrong. He had missed something and thats why I was in pain, he ended up doing an extensive surgery on me at 16, cutting bone and screwing it in at another spot, cutting muscle and ligaments to release pressure and cutting into one of my hamstrings so I wouldn't loose the ability to walk. Recovery for that was terrible. I couldn't walk, couldn't shoot, couldn't do much of anything. I gained probably 40 pounds over my 3 month recovery. I had finally recovered from it and was back in swing and ready for my first big event with my friends. It was an annual ball that the rotc puts on and I was finnally back with my family, couldn't do much but back. I remeber that night because it was one of the last times I felt complete. I was invites to another party a week after but I had to turn it down, my leg wasn't ready and I just couldn't.  I went to sleep early and woke up with over 100 notifications. Come to find out my best friend who had invited me the night before had gotten in an accidnet and died on the way home.I was shaken to my core. His back up driver was shit faced and killed him and it was all becuase I wasn't there. A month later I was at his funeral and we were able to give him a send off to be proud of, all I remember was crying. I had lost one of my two bestfriends, the people who stood by me and had to torn apart relationships in the process of grieving. That excat night another tragedy struck, the third in our trio, a friend of mine sense elementary had passed away from complications with the flu. I was absolutely devastated. I couldn't function. Both of my pillars just died within a month of eachother. I threw myself into shooting and my coach. He was all the support I had left. Fast forward 6 months to the summer. My surgeon had just told me the day before that my other leg needed the same procedure and I could no longer be eligible for military service, the next day I rolled my car down a 30 foot embankment trying to swerve around two dogs. Once I was out of the hospital my coach called me to check on me and told me we would get breakfast after his hiking trip. My coach was epileptic but always loved to go on adventures, he was the classic Jersey stereotype with a heart of gold. I loved that man with everything I had. He was all I felt I had left. He ended up having an episode while hiking and fell of the side of a cliff,  they found his body the next morning on a rock on the river. I was completely devistated, I didnt know what to do but luckily I had made one more friend that I could talk too. I got my second surgery and gained more weight from the depression and lack of movement. This guy became my best friend, helped me through alot and let me vent to him. Flashforward to last month. He is on trial for child sex abuse and has confessdd to it but is now fighting it. I know he is guilty and being a victim of sexual abuse as a child I hate him for it. One of my last friends raped and abused his fathers girlfriend's daughter for years. Here I am now in college across the state and I am beyond lost with no true direction to follow. I want to go home and live closer to my family, but I am engaged and she is from the same town I lived in.

What did I do to deserve my cousin molesting me until I was 12? What did I do to deserve my mom beating me and blaming me for her being in prison or jail 3/4ths of my life? What did I do to deserve my grandmother calling me useless, worthless, a bitch for trying to protect myself against her pedophile ex bf? What did I do to deserve to look at myself in the mirror and know that I am not special, I will never be special, and there’s high chances that I will die alone in my parent’s basement (figuratively) just like my aunt said I would.

You’ll think that everything goes back to normal, but here’s where you’re wrong. It’ll never be the same. Yes, you’ll be better, but the despair of falling into the same state again never really leaves you. You’ll tread carefully with your next move, learning how to identify symptoms, how to help yourself get out of it. But there’s only so much you can do. Because you’re addicted to those feelings of extreme sadness, it’s the only thing you feel, it helps you feel again. You’re voided of all other happiness, excitement, love. Sadness, extreme bouts of sadness, that’s the only feeling. Holding your breath, holding in your stomach, you hold yourself and tell yourself it will be over, but it keeps happening again. And again. Till that you learn to live with it. Till that it is normal. You’re afraid of someone seeing you like this, because when you’re in it, you can’t control how you feel, how your face is drained of all life, how you’ve lost all your appetite, how anxiety takes over till you can’t sleep, can’t focus, it takes over all your priorities, it takes away all that you love, it leaves you empty and anxious. It eats away at you, slowly, but surely. You can’t pull yourself out of it. You try to snap out of it, your friends try, they try, but it does not work like that. Then after depression is done playing with you, you start feeling better, still voided of other emotions, but no longer anxious or sad. It changes you, it changed you. You’ll think that this is it. You’re free. But boy, could you not be more wrong... it happens again. And it’ll keep happening. \\n\\nI am sick to my stomach, anxious till I can’t sleep, can’t breathe even.

On one hand, they'd stop calling me white. On the other, I could just forget about them. I don't know.\",\n",

If I'm in a bad mood right now then I won't give a fuck to anything. Even if I'm in my bad days I don't care if I'm disrespecting my family or if I'm being rude. I'm depressed but I care about my personal emotions. If I can't take care of my mental health then I should still atleast spoil myself by having the right to have reactions and feelings in situations. So if I roll my eyes on my uncle for controlling our family matters let me be. I hate it when people change plans and are fucking annoying. \",\n",

       "  'I hate it here I can’t stand my family friends school virus etc. Everyone is always so mean to me I’ve always been bullied and picked on for no reason when I’ve done nothing. I’ve been called fat ugly stupid had my acne pointed out etc. I am so insecure that I never leave the house and when friends try to call me out I always make up an excuse to stay in. I can’t even talk to my friends about my problems, they will never understand me. They have it easy. I can’t find love because I’ve been fucked over very brutally and ever since been scared. Life sucks I hate myself I’m embarrassed to be in my own body. Why was I such a target for bullying. Am I not that worthy of feeling good that someone needed to make fake accounts and make my life a living hell? Why did people make rumours about me why did people call me names I don’t understand. I just want to know why. Why am I so fat ugly stupid. I am so horribly insecure. Why do I suffer from anxiety. Why can’t life get any better for me it’s been this way for so long. When I was once happy it came dragging down. I have so much anger and hatred inside of me I just can’t anymore sometimes I scare myself. My parents piss me off so much. My mum read my diary without permission and told my dad shit in it and my dad told ppl shit about me and hits me why can’t I have privacy in thus house why does my brother have to be disabled. Why do I love food so much that I eat it to the point I feel sick? Why doesn’t anyone hire me? Honestly why am I still alive.',\n",
       "  'It’s been 3 years. In and out of each other’s lives over and over again. The first year we were together. It was long distance but we were together. I always traveled to you every time. To me you were worth anything no matter the distance. You were my world. You brought out a light in me that I didn’t know existed. You were my first true love. Ever since you broke up with me my world hasn’t been the same. On and off for 2 years we’ve contacted each other for who knows why. No one has brought the light into my life like you did. \\n\\nIf you asked me to come see you. I would drop everything to come see you. I’ve done that 3 times since we broke up. Each time was a bad experience but I loved you so I would do anything for you. Last time was before 2020. You told me you wanted to leave me behind in 2019. Here we are again you asking me to come see you. 6 hours away and $300 for 4 days. Right now I’m really struggling. I’ll be 21 years old this year. In my past 21 years of life I feel like I’ve done nothing right. I feel like I will never be anything. Same house, Same room for 21 years. Cheated throughout high school, didn’t go to college, never kept a job for more than 6 months. Stay jobless for months on end. I honestly have no desire to be anything. \\n\\nI have no plans. I have no future. I have nothing.',\n",

       "  \"I am a US citizen. Over 40. $150,000 in student loan debt. Just recently went through bankruptcy. Divorced. Recently became a convicted violent felon....\\n\\nMy life was on track and I had no problem paying off the student loan. I made a lot of money doing something I loved. Then I was screwed over by my ex-wife. I cheated on her and she ruined my life. If you have read the book or watched the movie Gone Girl, similar thing happened to me. I was wrong to cheat on her which fueled her hatred of me, but I am not sure I deserved to lose everything. Still, it was my fault.\\n\\nIt has been over two years and after 6 months in jail, I finalized my bankruptcy and I have about $10,000 left to restart my life. I can't get the jobs that I once had. I used to work in a mid-sized corporation making $80,000 a year and on my way to that six figures. My degree was unrelated to my previous line of work and it was in social work, so I can't use that for specialized jobs. My resume is filled with years of steady work and volunteering at charities for many many years, but that information is useless with my new label as an ex-convict.\\n\\nI have worked as a server for a few months now to get by. Due to my good behavior, my 7-year probation will end in 3. I have never had a temper or violent tendencies or other criminal records. I was just pushed to the limit and my reaction was recorded on tape and used against me. In the past 40 years of my life, I had never gotten angry, but this one instance practically ruined my life. I was driven to a breaking limit and it was very obviously orchestrated, but I broke the law. At least I didn't have to go to prison for 5 years. I was given 9 months in jail, released in 6 for being good. I really enjoyed teaching other inmates GED materials and other life skills. Read a lot.\\n\\nI am moving to one of the EU countries. I have a friend from college/work that can get me a visa in his country through his company for at least 10 years. He has seen me work and I am very professional when it comes to work ethics. It doesn't pay very well, but I should make about $30K a year to start. But without the $1500/month student loan payment, I don't see an issue.\\n\\nI have a year left on my supervised probation. State of Iowa is tough on criminals, but the judge and the probation officer has been good to me as I have been a model inmate and probationer.\\n\\nI am finalizing my bankruptcy. I owe over $60,000 in CC debt. Legal bills mostly.\\n\\nI have 2 undergraduate degrees (dual major). Most of my debt came from 2 years of master’s degree program that I was getting ready to finish. I had 2 semesters left when this happened. I can't finish the degree because I can't get licensed or do the required internship because felony excludes any places I can go to volunteer.\\n\\nThought about taking on another graduate degree, but as I have no intention of paying back, it would be considered a fraud now. While I am a criminal now, I still am hesitant to break the law. I could rack up another $60K in student loans for another graduate degree I can't use in the US.\\n\\nI make about $4 per hour plus tips now working as a server in a small restaurant that I was willing to overlook my past. I can't pay the $210,000 I owe. I am going to leave and never come back. There's nothing left for me here. I have 2 children that I can't see because of a court order for another 4 years. I can't afford the cost to visit the supervised visitation place allowed as I don't have a vehicle to get me that far and I can't really afford the $100+ taxi fare anymore. No public transportation goes there and I have to work weekends so I can't do the 2 hour walk there and the court only allows visits at their mother's convenience. This place was intentionally picked out of my reach. It kills me that I can't see them, but what good is a father who can't give them anything but grief and look of failure. I used to live on revenge, but I love my children too much to hurt their mother. Besides, I am not sure I can do it anyway. I am way more depressed than angry.\\n\\nWhat money I have left, I will use to resettle in another country. I can get by for another year working at this restaurant. Thank goodness that I could find that job. Most places don't hire violent felons. I understand that it is risky for their business. I have been violent once in my life. But it is what I am to others.\\n\\nI know it looks bleak for many and that's what drove you to search out this sub-reddit. It may seem like the bottom can't give out any further, but I wanted to share my story to let you know that maybe you have it better than I do. Not being able to vote reminded me that I can no longer be a citizen in the country that I held dear. Being ripped away from my children out of spite made me really hate myself. Not being able to pay back what I owe made me feel even more worthless. This is my story of why I am leaving. I hope you have a better luck with your life. Don't become a failure like me. I will die in a foreign land somewhere with the long-forgotten memories of my children whom I loved more than my life but I will never see again.\\n\\nAnd for those that are wondering how I can leave my children….\\n\\nI currently live in a group home. I can't rent any place as every place is owned by a company and they do background checks. The list for housing for people like me have a long waitlist. If I didn't have this job, I wouldn't be able to afford this group home. If I don't have an address, I can't get jobs. Can't imagine being able to afford a house anytime soon.\\n\\nI figure this life is going to continue until I get hurt or otherwise disabled. I don't see more than 15-20 years of hard labor. By then, background checks will be mandatory even to become a criminal....\\n\\nWhat good is a father that can't provide for his children? If I barely scrape by only to reach a point that I can't.....then what? Would I beg my children to feed me? Never. I wasn't able to give them anything and I would rather end it all than to be a burden on them. If I stay here, there's nothing guaranteed for me. If I leave and save for the next 10 years, I can give my children $50,000 each for college or to live a life. I have carefully calculated this amount and it is feasible. I don't expect forgiveness for not being around and I don't need anything in return, but I need to provide them with something because I want to be a father to my children. My ex-wife thought she could take this away from me to hurt me, but I refuse to accept it.\\n\\nIf it weren't for them, I would have just ended it all. I want to do this because I need them to know that I care for them. There will be years in between where I will seem worthless. I don't want them to live their lives believing that.\\n\\nNobody here knows that I am planning on leaving. I just had to say it somewhere as I haven't talked to anyone in a while.\",\n",

We got dinner multiple times a week and hung out regularly. We had things going on every weekend. I even thought I had met a girl. She seemed interested in me and we hung out a lot. She made me smile and I was actually happy. \\n\\nThen everything changed. \\n\\nWe all hung out one weekend a few weeks ago. Things became tense due to things outside of our control. People outside the group tried to spread hatred into what we had. But we stuck together and became even closer. It seemed like everyone was by each other’s side. \\n\\nSuddenly and without warning one of the group members dropped off the face of the earth. Deleted Facebook, left all the group messages, and dropped out of contact. Many of us attempted to contact them, but it was no use. No one could figure out what was going on. They were a main facilitator to our group so things quickly fell apart. Things went from hanging out regularly to nothing at all, Hardly even a text from anyone. \\n\\nShortly after I met with the girl I was interested in. She told me some awkward conversations happened in between her and the guy who left the group and she didn’t feel comfortable being a part of the group anymore. She also told me she was seeing someone which was a surprise to me. I should have expected that though. I told her about my depression. Who wants to be with someone who has so many issues...\\n\\n\\nI’m not sure why I wrote this since no one will read it. I guess I just wanted to reflect on things.

My father opened a restaurant in a foreign country and of course you need a partner from that country in order to allow that. It was just one day, so suddenly, we heard from friends that he lost his job and was banned from entering. My dad filed a lawsuit against him but that country takes ages to reply. My father stayed without a job for 6 months while we were suffering. We went through so much, my mothers salary wasn’t much it barely helped us. I went through depression through these 6 months and was suicidal, I even went through ed. \\n\\nAnyways, my father luckily got accepted in to a job luckily but of course the salary wasn’t as much as before. My dad’s work permit was put in hold from his former partner, so he couldn’t take a loan or transfer us money. He did find people to transfer though, luckily, but that didn’t solve our educational issue. At that time we were still in school but we only payed small amount of the fees. Time went by and found out the my father has fortunately won the case but his former partner made an appeal to pay less than the money he took from him. (We were depending on the money to pay our fees but it will only pay out our last year’s fees). My father had no choice but to agree after failed attempted appeal and they set a date to receive his money.\\n\\nThis is the 4th month and my dad didn’t receive the money nor his work permit yet they keep telling his excuses. 4th month my sister, 6th grader, and I, 12th grader, didn’t enter school. My parents are divorced and my mom keeps putting me in pressure to attack my dad for ruining my future and putting us in the low. Ill be honest, my sister and I don’t have a bond with our father, he’s like a bank to us, he doesn’t even talk to us unless he’s transferring money or updating about the court. He has emotionally abused my mom and I also believe the reason why we ended up in this mess was because of him. He doesn’t even have money saved up through the years he’s been working which is why we are suffering. \\n\\nI am a 12th grader who didn’t experience my senior year nor did I start applying for universities because my future is ruined from the hands of my father.  I feel like I have lost everything and it increased my anxiety and destroyed me socially and mentally. I really wish if I could end it all. I know repeating a year is an option but it’s a shame and humiliating. Seeing all my friends graduating and will be in universities while i’m below them destroys me. I do not understand why it would happen to us. I lost the meaning of happiness, i don’t even know how it feels anymore. I try to be happy but my mom ruins it for me by shouting and reminding me.

I can’t talk about anything personal to my family, as they’ll make fun of me for it and ignore it. I can’t talk to my girlfriend about it because I don’t want to ruin her mood and I want her to be happy. I’ve picked up drinking and smoking, and I’m only 16. My life is going to shit, and I’m dragging my body with it. I can’t tell anyone the things I’m doing or going through because it’ll ruin so many things in life. The few people I’ve talked to have helped me for a week or so, and then disappeared entirely. I have no faith or trust in anyone to stay and listen. I have no hope for my future, and at this point I feel like I’ll either be on the streets or dead. I wish I could get myself out of this hell hole, but I just can’t get the strength to.

       "  'Bear with me this is a bit of a long story. Il make my introduction quick. I’m a 15 year old girl from urban Georgia attending a fairly prestigious high school.\\n\\nWARNING* if you are triggered by thoughts of suicide or self harm please don’t read this\\n\\nI wouldn’t say my life has been particularly tough...except the past few years. In the past few years I’ve had to leave my 9 year long friends and go to a different school, form new friendships, only for them to be broken again when I had to go to another new school because my parents believed it was best. In 7th grade(first year at school number 3) I found out that my mother had developed a drinking problem and had started abusing my father, who never hit her back even though all her abuse. It shook me to my core that someone I trusted so much could simply turn into a monster...I was and still am scared of her. I became withdrawn socially because run my mind “why should I trust more random people around me when they will either leave me behind or could become like my mother.” I fell into a depressive state. I would dig my nails into my wrist to stop myself from crying everyday. Every night I was up til midnight or later, listening to my mother yell at my father for thing he had never done, hearing her throw all sorts of shit against the walls, and finding dents in the morning. I lived in constant fear basically, but 8th grade was when I hit rock bottom. My mother abuse became more physical, she threw a large lamp at him, slapped him in the face with shaving cream when he was sleeping, threw and broke multiply glasses, and scratched whore into the side of two of our cars...one of which I’ll be driving. She had accused him of sleeping with a much MUCH younger co-worker (she was like 20 and he’s in his late forties) which she had no evidence nor reason to believe, because whenever I asked her why she thought that she just said “he is”. She also became a bit abusive towards me, yelling at me for minor things. I became a soulless empty husk all of 8th grade. I honestly don’t remember much since I was a walking mindless zombie. I considered suicide multiply times that year, even thinking about the most painless and quick way to do it. There was a night I was so close to doing it but didn’t have the guts to leave my old sister and father who I both loved so much, behind. I continued to dig my nail into my arm, I started punching my leg and or banging my head on a wall when I was in a bad state. I also started cutting up my arm with my nails, which were pretty long and once cut my leg up with an exacto knife...I hated everything about myself, I couldn’t look myself in the mirror with out sobbing, I had a 2-3 supportive friends at dance, but no one at school had any idea. I faked a quiet smile throughout the whole year. I stopped going to lunch and at a snack in the bathroom. I became unable to handle being in crowds or loud noises (because of my moms yelling I’ve also developed a fear of yelling and have to calm myself down). \\n\\nBeginning 9th grade I slowly started to get better, I began talking to and reaching out to a bit more people at school, which was pretty difficult and took many tries to even speak to others. My sister realized what was going on and had been helping me, I got a bit closer with my sister close friends too. I still struggled at feeling useless and I hated watching myself dance even though I’m at a pre professional level, I forgot to mention earlier but I dance 5-6 days a week 9am-5pm on Saturdays and am a soloist in my student company, but i have become a bit more comfortable with my looks. I’ve remember the first time I genuinely laughed since 7th grade. I wasn’t close friends with anyone at school but I felt more comfortable commenting on people’s posts and texting them to ask questions. I stopped letting people take advantage of me ( people would ask for me to buy them food and then be like “omg you are so my best friend thank you so much!!” ). I’m still healing and have many scars. My father snapped and told me mother he wants a divorce, he attitude changed completely once she realized he was serious, because she knew I would want to go with him and she cleaned up her act trying to act all nice and buy me things so I would break him more than she ever could but I didn’t and simply pushed back at her. I’m no longer scared of my mother, she’s raise me to be intelligent which sucks for her cause I now can fight back with legitimate facts and reason, I can now stand up for myself and am not afraid to yell at her at the top of my lungs. I would say I’m okay. But I’m not.\\n\\nMy sister is leaving for collage and I’m scared since she has been my main support leg. My dance studio is falling apart and all three of my other support legs, my best friends in the world. Are ll moving away to pursue dance at a non toxic studio( whole different story there ). I’m getting shaken up again because like I said earlier, I have a bit of a fear of people leaving me behind, and all my support legs are slipped just as I’m trying to build new ones. I’m so scared of what’s gonna happen, I’m scared of falling back into depression, I want to live but sometimes it doesn’t seem worth it still to this day. I’m scared please help. Everything I’ve done and fought through feels like it’s crumbling and I feel like im gonna retreat back into my shell. I know this was long but I have no other place to turn to and would appreciate some advice.\\n\\n\\nEdit: I also want to get this off my chest, I was in a relationship with a fun quirky guy who made me laugh, we were best friends in a relationship. But when we went to different schools we broke it off. I’ve tried keeping in contact but it kinda connects to me feeling left behind. I know I’m young, people will say it’s stupid but it’s been a year or so and I still miss him, I think I might have even loved him. I don’t know how to move on...I scared of being left behind again. There’s a guy at my new school I kinda like but I don’t want to seem annoying.',\n",

       "  'I’m new here to Reddit, don’t exactly know how this place works, but I needed to get some stuff off my chest and hopefully get some answers on how to get better. \\n\\nI’m an 18 year old girl, graduated in June of 2019 and have always felt empty. And when I’m not feeling empty I just feel sad or angry at how my life was growing up.  I was raised in an abusive household, my mother being a violent drunk and my dad never being home, since he hated dealing with her. \\n\\nEvery “friend” I’ve had has either hurt me physically, talked about me behind my back, started rumors, or was just always rude ever since I was in elementary school. Despite that, there were moments when they made me feel happy and that things would be okay. Then after high school ended last year, I got tired and dropped my only best friend because of how toxic she was. \\n\\nShe kept me from making other friends, was sexual with any guy I came into contact with that was interested in me, and even threatened other people “not to touch her girlfriend” (me). No we weren’t dating, but she always made people stay away from me my entire school career since the 6th grade all the way up to 12th, even told me to break up with my first “boyfriend”, which I did because she was my friend, but then they started dating a few days later. (Which is why I don’t count him. Plus we were like 11, so it wasn’t that serious anyway.) Even then I stayed with her till the end, was the third wheel in all her relationships, took all the toxicity to the point that I never trusted anyone again, and never got into a relationship I order to please her. Yes I’ve been single basically my whole life. I’ve never even been kissed. \\n\\nWhen I told her that we weren’t good for each other last year after we graduated she literally sobbed, but I felt nothing because of all the hurt she made me feel. She talked about me negatively, kept people from me, did things with the guys I would start talking to, then ditch me whenever she could and I’d just be alone until she needed to rant about her problems. \\n\\nMy dad also became very verbally abusive when my mom ran away when I was around 12, and it has really affected my opinion on men, along with the guys who insisted they were into me, but easily got swept up by sexual desire when it came to my ex-best friend if she offered herself. \\n\\nNot only that, but when I was a toddler I was sexually abused/harassed/assaulted. By my babysitter and her boyfriend, which has also caused a bit of trauma when it comes to trusting people. And in elementary school I was cornered at a fence by older boys, luckily I got away, then another time in elementary I was pinned down by a boy my age, got away by kicking him where the sun don’t shine. Then when I was in foster care at around age 9, an entire group of older boys surrounded me, held me by my arms and legs as one tried to get between my thighs. I had never been so scared in my life, but have always been a fighter, so I got away by, once again, kicking him where the sun don’t shine, which pretty much caused the boys to try and help him up, giving me time to escape as I kicked and scratched my way out. When I did though, I ended up scraping my back by hiding under some type of wooden thing and have a small scar on my back because of it. \\n\\nDuring high school I just got the usual cliché foot being rubbed up my leg by some douche, or the slow gravitation of the hand up my thigh to my crotch type of thing by some horny jerk. Not too serious, but still very god damn scary since you feel trapped even though you’re in a classroom with a teacher at their desk. \\n\\nI could have asked for help, but my whole life I had always been forced to keep quiet and deal with things myself, since my friends didn’t care, my parents never cared, not even the teachers I told that I was being abused at home when I was in elementary cared, which made me not trust adults with authority. The only time I did get help was when I got put into an all women’s home when I was little, because my mom lied saying my dad was the abusive one when it was her. \\n\\nHowever, each time I was put back with my family. I didn’t stay in the all women’s home, or foster care where a lot of other bad stuff happened, I still ended up with my verbally abusive dad, who always wanted me to be perfect. I got excellent grades all through out high school, never ditched, was always above the class in physical education, but even then, my dad called me an average person. That I wasn’t special. And it sent me back to when my mom told me I was an accident, and the times he told me I was an accident and basically was supposed to be given up for adoption. \\n\\nI grew up being told I wasn’t supposed to be here, and now, naturally believe that I don’t mean anything. What happens to me doesn’t matter. I exist to be used and tossed away. Every guy has only wanted me for my body, every “friend” only wanted me because I was there when they needed some cash or when they needed to rant. I exist for my dad to keep using me to take care of my 5 sisters, to cook, to clean, to do laundry. That’s all I’ve been doing since I was 8. Cooking, cleaning, raising kids...is that really all I’m good for? \\n\\nIs that really why I’m here? I love to draw, but my dad says that my art is pointless. I’ve done everything I could to make him proud of me, but every time I make an effort to actually leave and grow up he makes me feel like I’m worthless and won’t make it. I haven’t even been able to get a job of my own, because he wouldn’t give me my birth certificate or social security card. Luckily I got them myself, but I even bought a car with money I saved up, and he won’t let me touch the keys. I bought it in August. It hasn’t even been driven by me yet. Recently I even paid for my ID and my permit test, which amounted to about $70 with the money I saved up from my grandparents as gifts since they can never visit. I’ve paid for everything myself, gotten things myself, but he won’t let me do anything. I even got a scholarship, applied to college and got in before high school ended, but he sent me to my grandmas the day I had to get my scholarship money and then he made me drop my college classes after I came back from her place. \\nI even planned on living in the dorms and getting a part time job as I took my classes at the college. \\n\\nWhat do I do? I feel like I should just end everything since I know nobody will ever actually love me for me, and I know that I’ll just get taken advantage of again even if I leave my dad and sisters. \\n\\nI’ll end up alone, and homeless since I can’t even go into a store without being paranoid a man will ultimately assault me, because I’ve been followed in a store, and ogled since before I even hit puberty, which has added to my already severe social anxiety.\\n\\nMy 11 year old sister even noticed a guy following us and stood right behind me because she realized he was staring right at my behind, then followed us out of the store a few months ago. I didn’t even know that was why she was standing so close to me before she told me once we got in the car together. I thought I had been the only one who noticed a guy was being creepy because she’s still so young, but I guess she’s old enough to know when someone has bad intentions.\\n\\nShe always offers to go to the store with me because she knows how scared I get when alone. \\n\\nMaybe I need therapy? I know it’s not normal for my social anxiety to be this bad. I even stutter while talking to my family. \\n\\nWhat can I do to fight off all of my trauma and anxiety, so I can function like a normal person in society? I want a job, I want to drive without being scared due to flashbacks from when my mom would drink and drive with me in the car when I was little. I want to trust a guy and love him unconditionally. I want to have friends I can depend on and help. \\n\\nI want a life that’s worth living. Not one where I regret being alive every morning when I wake up. \\n\\nWhat do I do? \\n\\nAnd sorry this is so long, I’ll be surprised if anyone even reads this.',\n",
       "  'I (24,f) was in an abusive relationship for 4 years that ended 2 years ago and, as a result, I am on antidepressants. I won’t go into details but it was physically and emotionally abusive to the point I was either beaten up or told to kill myself daily (or that I’m ugly, disgusting, nobody loves me, etc). \\n\\nMy problem is the following... I don’t talk to any of my old friends because of it. I am so ashamed of what I did (promising everyone I’d never go back to him but doing the opposite + everyone knowing me as the poor girl who got beaten up a lot) that I stopped talking to them and they stopped contacting me in return. Which is relatively okay since I moved to another country last year anyway and I had the opportunity to make new friends. And yet, I couldn’t. I tried to attend parties and they all resulted into me getting panic attacks and having to leave. It usually happened when guys tried to approach me.\\n\\nWhich leads this to my next problem... I have low self-esteem issues and, even though I’m not the ugliest on earth since I get stared at or hit on every once in a while, I still feel like every guy wants to fool me or harm me somehow every time they approach me. Like I don’t consider myself pretty enough for more than a hookup. I know it’s an irrational fear and just because I dated the wrong person doesn’t mean that everyone is the same. But I can’t stop it. I also noticed that because of my fear of men/dating, I refuse social situations if they involve parties or any of that stuff. And people stop contacting me when I don’t go to their birthdays, etc.\\n\\nI’m writing this because I seriously don’t know how to get over this issue. I always thought that giving it time could heal it, but it’s been two years and I become more fearful with each passing day. The antidepressants are good because I don’t feel suicidal anymore, but it’s not like I’m living that much either. \\n\\nI feel like I left a lot of the stuff out but I didn’t want to make this way too long. If anyone has any advice on how to get over it, I’d gladly appreciate it.',\n",

I dont ever feel comfortable with myself and my parents are extremely against the LGBT community. Ive never come out to them as bi or trans, and I never plan to.

My childhood, 3 family dogs that helped me emotionally, my birth mom, my birth siblings. Im going to tell my whole life story im (14F) im going to tell you what my childhood has taught me, then i will tell you about my childhood.\\n\\nMy childhood told me that the people who are supposed to love you the most can be the same person who hurts you.My childhood taught me that their are terrible people in the world, even the person you love the most. I learned that life is hard. It will always be hard.You have sad times, and good times. You can wake up hating the world or loving it. You can decide to fight your problems, or just run away from them.Me personally... I have a lot of bad times, I wake up hating the world, and im running away from my problems. Living sucks, and im here for 4 people right now. I hate living, but im here for the things I love doing.\\n\\nMy childhood? I hated it. My birth mom had me and 3 other children, my sister, and my two brothers. im 14, my brother is 13 my other brother is 12 and my sister is 11. I have not seen them in years. But when I was younger (about 5-6) I treated my siblings terrible, so badly, and I hate myself for it, I hate what I did to them. I hate saying this as it kills me, but I was my birth moms favorite. I was the oldest, and she had younger kids. But she kept all her attention on me, and because of that my brother almost got hit by a fucking car, he was 5. My adoptive moms friend ran to get him before it happend.( I love her for what she did). It was during one of our meetings ( I had been taken out of my birth moms house). My birth mom is terrible. She would leave me and my siblings on peoples porches, who knows what those people did to us. And she would go out to drink while we were at those random peoples houses. She tried to kill my sisters dad, right in front of us. We suffered PTSD because of the things she did to us. I have arachnophobia because she would taunt me with spiders, and the would put them on me, and make me hold them. I was 6 or 7 at the time.\\n\\nMy present/new family I was fostered when I was 3 by the family I have now. But I still got to go to meetings with my birth mom. (They were awful) I was ten adopted by the family I have now. My cousin tried to rape me when I was 8 and he was 12. Now I hate to be touched, especially by boys. My cousin has issues. so when I started screaming and my auntie caught him, I got in trouble by her because I told her he was hurting me. She never told anyone, and because I got in trouble, I thought it was my fault so I didnt tell anyone ether. Now I still have to see him. I flinch every time he hugs me or kisses me on the cheek. It makes me sick, and turns my stomach.\\n\\nMy adoptive mom later had two boys. One is 8 and the other is 6. I hate them both, but I hate the 8 year old one more. Im a terrible sister and a burden to everyone who knows me. Im annoying and when people ditch me I go crawling back to them like some pathetic dog. Even if it was never my fault. Im always apologizing to people and it annoys the shit out of them. Im emotionally unstable, have terrible anger issues, and really bad mood swings. Im suicidal and have 3 failed attempts. I was hospitalized 3 times, 2 for suicide attempts, 1 for running away. My grandma is mean to me and looks hat me like she is just utterly disgusted with my existence, or presence. Im super clingy, and love hugging/ touching people (They let me, they understand) Their is an aching in my heart that never really goes away. I cry myself to sleep. I want to die. But im to scared to kms. I wish I had the guts to do it. But I just dont. Like I mentioned earlier. Im here for 4 people right now. They help me so much, and sometimes I think that they pretend to care, and that makes me feel so ungrateful, and selfish. I love all 4 of them very much. So im still here. Im trying to keep myself alive, but its really hard.\\n\\nWell, thanks for reading? I guess, im not sure.',\n",

What comes next is real. My breathing, however, rather than bringing relief, only allows me to think somewhat clearer as I now form full sentences with the struggle of reason and maybe, just maybe, a hint of truth. I continue nonetheless, surging forth as every action now becomes a burden. Every step. Every breath. Every thought. \\n\\nI gaze up at the overhead light. It’s bright and I squint my eyes closed, and I push further. As I continue, looking onward now, I begin to realize that the light was not so blinding, but rather dim in the hallway. Perhaps it was the dark effect upon my eyes that made the light so blaring and offensive. I squeeze my eyelids shut and forget the matter. I need to move forward. I must move on. \\n\\nOne foot, being my left, is now ahead of the rest of my body. My thoughts begin to race more and more. “What will it be like?” “What will happen?” I use my right foot to push myself forward until I gain traction again in my left, and continue the motion in that foot. “What am I going to do now?” Tears are now welling up in my eyes. I know because the light had dried them up. \\n\\nThis is more than an issue of dry eyes, however. Rather than my body naturally stopping the flow of tears, upon which my eyes become wet again, they proceed to flow forth. I feel this in my subconscious, but my conscious mind is occupied elsewhere. My heart, now following the path of my brain, now beats forcefully, moving me to panic. I know that I need to calm down. My head begins to feel light and swirly. I grab hold of the wall, flattening my hand upon its cool surface. I bend down and catch my breath once more. I pause for maybe a second or two, dreading what is to become of me. \\n\\nMy conscious mind, now updated to the previous conditions, struggles to interpret my bodily reactions. Fear? No. Anxiety? Of sorts, but not nearly as strong as the feeling of--\\n\\nMy hand that was once on the wall now grabs an icy cold door handle. My body shudders and my mind goes blank. I turn the frozen mechanism until its counterpart releases the door to be opened. No thoughts. No feeling. This was it. I feel the atmosphere change as I push forward upon the door. The darkness retreats to the faint light of the hallway, and I see it. \\n\\nOne foot steps into the room. The revealing light, still dim, peels back the darkness to show my naked eyes what fate that I would behold. It’s an empty apartment. My thoughts continue, slowly now, as the tears still flow down the sides of my face. The feeling that I had felt was sadness. No danger existed in the apartment-- that is, until I entered into the room.',\n",

In practice this means that I have less energy than others. This meant that I had to choose and I prioritize school. I don’t really regret that decision I believe school to be a very important, especially because I have always aspired to wards prestige which really is just a sign of my insecurity’s ‘if I can’t make you like me I can outshine you. The consequences of my choice means that I am more or less socially isolated with no intimate friends in sight. I have started to make an effort to handle this problem using Reddit, Which I’m quite proud of.  \\n\\n\\nA normal day for me is that I wake up to the sound of ‘wonderful World’, I do my morning routine, go to school attend my classes, I eat lunch alone because I can’t handle the noise of the cafeteria, so I have to have my headset on which doesn’t make for good conversation. I take the train home. When I come home I go straight to bed to sleep or watch YouTube for several hours because I’m too exhausted to do anything else. Repeat five days a week all year long.\\n\\nAs some of you can imagine that this existence of mine hasn’t been all happy (hence why am posting in this subreddit) but I was never really proper low, I never cut myself (although I did punch myself on Acacian) I was thinking I suicidal thoughts but I wasn’t serious about it I never tried, I wanted to live. It doesn’t change that I wasn’t  happy. I’m talking in the past tense but I might as well talk in present tense it’s just that hindsight is easier.\\n\\n\\nNow the title of this post ‘is not depressed enough’  so let me tell you about that. \\n\\nAs a person with all these fancy diagnoses I have contact with the psychiatric care. I do have the occasional but meeting but those are not about my psyche, it’s  to check on my medicine. I tell them about my struggles but nothing happens. Mostly because of my decent grades. If we are extra annoying they will give me a good for nothing meeting, to shut my mother up. I get there are people way worse than me but just because I lost a hand and some other guy loses all of its limbs doesn’t mean that I shouldn’t get medical attention, right? \\n\\nTLDR: i’m feeling blue but the system won’t help me because I’m not blue enough.\\n\\n\\nPs I apologize for the poor grammar i’m usually more thorough when I edit my posts but I’ve been at this for such a long time and I feel like Posting sooner than later...',\n",

       "  'It feels like nothing that I do is ever good enough. I am in love with my ex and we are trying to start as friends again to see where it can lead but he met another girl from sweden and I can\\'t stand the thought of him with another girl.. I love him more than anything and though our relationship was toxic for a long time, we\\'ve both truly matured and changed in that sense. He unblocked me recently and we started talking but all I can see is his snapscore going up when he isn\\'t even opening my messages... A little bit of background: We met online on Black Ops 2 in September of 2015; we were both awkward teenagers who didn\\'t have many friends outside of gaming. I started having a crush on him solely based on his humor and his voice. We started \"dating\" the day after we met and we were inseparable for a few months. It took a while to show each other what we looked like but we both found each other attractive. He got a PS4 and moved on from PS3 where I was stuck, so the only way we would talk was on FaceTime and snapchat. This is right around the time we were discovering sexual things so we ended up sending each other nudes at like 14/15 years old. My dad found out and took my phone in March of 2016. It was taken until the end of the summer. We reconnected when I got it back and it was like we never stopped talking. He was there for me through all of my panic attacks and my insecurities and it just changed my life. This shows why I have become so reliant on him for my happiness I suppose. I can\\'t get over him even though we\\'ve never met in person. We\\'re off and on and off and on but we always come back to each other. I can\\'t tell my friends this because they think he isn\\'t right for me and they find dating online cringeworthy. I just think that there\\'s a low probability that the person you\\'re destined to be with lives in the same city or even state as you do. I don\\'t know where I\\'m going with this though. I just feel hopeless and I\\'m starting to fall back into my depression. I know this all probably sounds stupid but he is honestly my first and only love. I\\'ve never met somebody who has done so much for me and been there for me as much as he has... I feel invisible in every aspect of my life besides when he and I talk. And now even that is going away because he is ignoring me and moving on. I\\'m sorry if I sound whiny I just have no idea what to do. I have some friends to talk to but i\\'m lonely if I don\\'t have him. I wanted to go to therapy after I was feeling suicidal but my family can\\'t afford it and there is no place that takes the state insurance within a 50 mile radius. I\\'m sorry for ranting.

       "  \"It's been a couple months since my last depressive episode, I was doing great, I was focusing on school, socializing, (thought) I was patching things up with my family and was generally speaking feeling pretty good about everything. However this pandemic has pulled me all the way back to where I was months ago, all my hard work wasted. I'm scared. I have never been that low before, during those months I had been hospitalized, attempted suicide on multiple occasions and felt nothing except the urge to be gone. I don't want to go back to that, the feeling of complete helplessness, feeling like no matter what I do I can't get out of this hole I'm in, despite wanting to more than ever. I always know that things are going to get better, I know I won't be in this much pain constantly but I don't know if it's worth it. Sure, I'll miss out on things, never get to experience the things my friends will in the future but is it really worth it? Going through months on numbness, pain, sadness when all I get in return is a month or two of feeling okay? I used to want to die while I was happy because I knew in the future I would feel like shit again but of course I could never bring myself to do it because at the time I was content. Anyway, back to the present, I can feel myself slipping back into my old habits now that I am in isolation, self harm, not eating properly etc. I feel like my life is ruined, I can't see a future for myself anymore. I don't want to die but I also don't want to live anymore. Ideally I would just disappear, leave everything, all my responsibilities, family, everything. Start fresh. But I know that's selfish and unfair and wouldn't solve the problem, just put it off until I feel the need to escape again. Isolation has been very difficult for me considering the only things that actually helped was being able to see my friends, since I don't get along with the family I live with. I am now realizing how much I rely on drugs, not only to numb myself but to simultaneously make me feel something. I don't really know what to do. For some reason I have completely isolated myself from all my friends, I don't think I've talked to any of them in about a week (I'm not really sure why to be honest). I really do not get along with my family, for no other reason except the fact that my mother thinks I'm a fuck up, which is completely possible but I believe we jut don't have the same values. I don't know. All I know is that in the end my death is inevitable, it's just a matter of when.\\n\\nSorry my writing is a mess, if you actually read all that, I think I just needed an outlet.\\n\\nAlso I know that as soon as I move out I'll hopefully feel a lot better, my mother is really the cause of, or at least makes my mental health a lot worse however that isn't a possibility as I'm only 16.\\n\\nMy mother knows about my mental health and how bad I'm doing yet refuses to help or even recognize it, despite me being diagnosed as she is worried it will tarnish the family reputation as well as my own. I guess I have a good life, I'm very lucky to be considered attractive, I'm popular, always been selected to be in the highest grade football team, unlike some people on here who complain about being lonely or how they think they deserve are monsters because they have never kissed a girl. No, I know I'm very privileged to be in the position I'm in, I have nothing to complain about, I've had girlfriends all through school as well as doing relatively well in all my classes. Yet somehow, despite the fact that my life is so good I can't find it in myself to be happy. My family thinks everything I do is for attention, my suicide attempts, getting arrested, everything. But it's not. They think that because I have a good life I should be happy and they're right. But I'm not.\\n\\nEdit: If you read this please just say something, anything. I honestly just need some kind of recognition that how I'm feeling is valid.\",\n",

They kick him when he plays football (when he doesn\\'t even have the ball), they poke his eyes for fun and keeps pushing him off the football field.

       "  \"I posted this on the lonely subreddit, but I'm also depressed and have been for several years (which despite how people try to tell me otherwise, I am well aware my mental health tends to be lacking in some areas). My question is: has anybody been in the same or similar situations? This isn't the worst, but it is up there. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nRANT: I don't understand how I can go to such lengths for people, and not one of them will do the same for me. I have gained, lost, and left friends over the course of several years, and so far have found that not one of them is willing to put in the effort of maintaining and strengthening our friendship, beyond the first couple of months at least. I have very little friends because of this since at some point you realize you're so sick of chasing after people who don't care enough to do the same. The friends I do have are not very close friends, mostly friends by circumstance, but I fear that I cling to these fragile friendships, probably too much in their eyes, because I'm so terrified to be alone. I look at people who have big friend groups and I don't know how they do it, most people I think could be good friends turn out to be stuck in that petty highschool mindset of I'm better than you so will somehow put you down. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI guess my low self-esteem comes from both lack of friends and lack of being able to keep the friendships I do have. This is where I wonder if I'm the problem. Is it my personality that puts people off? I honestly don't know. For example: when it was my birthday a couple of years ago, I was the youngest of the group so pretty excited to finally be turning 16, looking back I don't know why, earlier in the year I had gone all out for my best friend at the time. When it came to mine, I didn't understand why nobody had done something similar, I wasn't expecting a big huge present like I had got them (maybe hoping, but not expecting). Even a pizza lunch would have made my day, which was something we did for our friends birthdays, later after my birthday, I found out that a group chat had been made to organize it but my close friends at the time soon decided I talked too much about my birthday so they weren't going to get me anything past a card. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs you can imagine I was extremely hurt, not to mention this was one of the reasons I started to spiral hard into depression. Honestly, I don't think my self-esteem has really built up since them, I constantly doubt myself, if I'm talking too much, not listening enough, putting enough/too much effort into friendships. I have since changed friend groups of which I have since kept friends with 2-3 people after leaving for university. At university I didn't find as many friends as I thought I would, has anyone been in a similar situation? I guess I just don't know if I'm so lonely/depressed because of self-sabotage or not. But by God does loneliness and depression creep up on you at the weirdest and most inopportune of times. Has anyone been in a similar situation? If so, please give me advice on what I'm doing wrong.\",\n",

When the sun came up, as I stayed up all night, I got ready for school; put my death letters on my desk; and prepared to say my goodbye's to my friends. When I looked in the mirror while I was getting ready it had hit me what I had done. I had begun to end my life, when I am only very young and have not even experienced the majority of my life. I broke down in tears and went downstairs and told my parents I had overdosed. We immediately went to the ER and I told ym parents I was sorry and that I knew it was too late as the medicine was already into my system. They couldn't pump my stomach because, as I had said, it was too late. The last thing I remember was eating scrambled eggs and then proceeding to throw them up. After 5 minutes I had my first seizure. My dad was the only one in the room with me besides the nurse. The nurse had no idea what to do and immediately ran for the doctor. All my father could do was sit there and watch me as my eyes rolled back into my head and I started to die. I was medivaced to the ICU at Vidant medical center which is a leading hospital where my father had previously been treated at. I survived through that seizure and had multiple smaller ones over the course of two days. I do not remember those days. Apparently I was awake but I was out of it and I was hallucinating. I was transferred to the pediatric ward after another day when I was stable but still throwing up. After 3 days in the pediatric unit I was medically stable and able to keep food down so I was transferred to Bryn Marr mental hospital. I stayed there for a week during my treatment and was released today. I realized, while I was in there, the result of my actions. I effected my parents and my closest friends. My father said to me that he continues to have flashbacks of me on the table in the ER having my seizure and that he cried himself to sleep nearly everynight for the past 2 weeks. I hope my story has made some of you re-think suicide. It is not worth it and life will never be that bad. Please think about what you are doing and please consider the effects and the destruction you will cause if you go through with it. Life will always get better. I can't take back what I did and I can't take back the sadness, grief, and heartache I have caused the ones around me and the guilt of that will stay with me forever.

No matter what I start the day thinking about I usually end up in the topic of death, specifically mine. When I first started the job about 3 months ago I was in alot worse shape, having just gone through some life altering events. I had been kicked out by my Nars parents after 18 years of emotional, mental and sometimes physical abuse. I wanted to leave as soon as I turned 18 but didn\\'t have any money, so was trying to save and they kicked me out a couple weeks later. My amazing brother took me in and got me a job with some people he knows. Anyways directly after all of this I spent Pretty much every day fantasizing about different ways to kill myself. I now owe my brother some money and my death would screw him over. So I got by, by thinking something similar to \"once you pay him back, you can go ahead\" and started self harming again. Drinking and using rec drugs in my off time has also helped me cope. After spending so much time with him, I realized that if I committed suicide I would cause him genuine pain. Now I fantasize, hoping something bad will happen and result in my death. I think about all the different ways. A robber could come into the shop and kill me, I could be walking home in the dark and get hit by a car. But several times a day I think about how easy it would be to jump in front of a car or train on my morning commute, how easily I could get lost in the woods by out house, how I could make it look like an accident.

I\\'m not sure if this counts as an improvement.\\n\\nOne of my work friends that I talk to ( for the most part not about this stuff) told me that she thinks I may have manic depression and somewhat severe anxiety. I agree with her assessment and think I may also have ADHD, and possibly some form of PTSD bc of my upbringing. Im starting to feel like a crazy person.

My dads current suffering from depression severe ptsd, and is bipolar and I don’t want to add more pain onto him, that in fact his daughter is a totally mess and depressed all the time. \\nI need therapy, I know.

We must experience enough of the pain before we understand who we really are, which is pure energy, pure light. When we realize how great each of us really is, we can start to take responsibly for our actions. We can see how our actions affect those around us because everyone around us looks up to us in one way or another, its true. Some look up to us for our humor, some see us with a strong work ethic and wonder how to pick up on that, or others may re-enact our demeanor when we are at our best. \\n\\nAt our best we are unstoppable. When we stay focused and attain right living, right thought and right action, we become what most would define as noble and courageous. We actually defy what culture is telling us is normal. In a way we are stubborn, saying no to the norm, but those wallowing in the norm see us and wonder how they do it, just like we wondered how our role models did it. \\n\\nBecome your own role model. Become something great, it’s really not that hard to do. Once you understand that greatness is your natural state, all thats left to do is act on it. Claim whats rightfully yours. \\n\\n\\nYou have immeasurable power within you. What does that mean and how do you get it?\\n\\nIt means that you are made up of energy. What runs your body and mind, the driver behind the life your in, is pure energy. You are made up of knowing, intuition, responsibility, joy, all of it is you and your natural state. \\n\\nHow do you tap into that. How do you get the sap from this tree. Believe. First start by believing in yourself and what your trying to do. Everything starts with an initial idea, a first thought. Even depression begins with a thought. Take what you want in life and tell yourself it can be done. Say it outloud \"I can do this.\" Because you can if you believe it. \\n\\nTapping into that power, into the real you, is just a matter of being aware it exists and trying to see it. Once we start seeing life through this new vision, we see it more and more. Soon you will notice moments in your day when you could have reacted, but you didn\\'t. You will notice timing to be precise, people react differently to you, life begins to unfold the way you want, naturally. \\n\\nIve seen this and I live this way. There are many ways to go about this. Once you become aware of this truth and start believing in it, you will generally never be able to regress into your old self. There will be slips and falls, of course there has to be, but we no longer get down and disappointed. We use the challenges as stepping stones to become stronger. \\n\\n**I know you are amazing. I wish you knew that too. Someone out there right now envies you for something. Someone wishes they could have some aspect of your character. Without even realizing it, people depend on us. And if this is just projection, then I\\'m projecting the most loving, warm, heartfelt feeling right at you. I am blasting you with all the love I have got. Because you do matter, you are important, you will change someones life one day, you will get what you want, it is only a matter of positive self-perception and hard work.

Instead of being marked on exams due to the pandemic, we are being marked on assessments and it makes me feel like a dumb person as I got bad grades in most of my assessments which is no wonder why my dream university didnt really consider me. Being in quarantine and in  this pandemic makes me feel anxious. The future makes me feel anxious. I'm a very sensitive person, no doubt but I just wanted to let my emotions out in here. I'm not good with certain changes and I didnt meet my expectations and I just feel like a terrible person.\",\n",

       "  \"I got sent home from work tonight for getting frustrated during a call. I think I deserved it.  Think the way my boss ragged me out was possibly a little overboard. I do know that there is this guy that gets very frustrated at work all the time. He hits his hands against his head (not really hard) flails his arms and gives everyone one in the room a middle finger because something a customer said he didn't like. Never before had a worked somewhere where that was considered acceptable. But as far as I know, he doesn't get sent home. And this is the first time it has happened to me. My concern is, I'm going to get frustrated again at some point with a caller. \\n\\nI am also concerned about what my team supervisor is going to do when I go into work tomorrow. I was told by the manager on duty that I was getting sent home that it would be at least one point and counted as an unexcused absence. But I am concerned she may be talking to her boss, the call center manager and trying to insist that I need to be fired. \\n\\n I only make 9 bucks an hour after being there around six years. I don't really have anywhere to go. I was in special education classes my entire life. I was never able to complete a degree in college. I have attempted repeatedly to get another job but for crying out loud, I suck at operating a cash register. Last time I did that my till was always over or under what it suppose to be when I counted my draw at the end of my shift. \\n\\nPhysically, I can't do something where I am on my feet all the time. It just seems like I was never able to develop the skills needed to get a better job. But also some jobs, I am not sure I can handle emotionally.

I would be better of dead if I lose this job. \\n\\nMy parents tried to raise me to be so much more than what I am. But I'm just a failure. My mother deserved a daughter who could take care of her as she gets older. Someone giver her grandchildren that would bring her so much joy.   I'm a useless piece of crap that doesn't deserve to live. I have an older brother that is a teacher and had a doctorate in I think Jazz education.

I can't do that as it won't change anything. At best, I will just stop caring about my shitty life. Here are all \\\\[or just half\\\\] of the reasons why I don't wanna live anymore.\\n\\nCHILDHOOD\\n\\nFucked up, I was beaten, screamed at, my parents should have divorced years ago. It was toxic and made me angsty, insecure, socially disabled girl. No real friends, I have always talked to myself and my imaginary boyfriends or friends and I still do. Once I finally left for college I felt lost. I stopped feeling constant fear but had no mental resources to make any real friends or relationships.\\n\\nI have experienced multiple rejections \\\\[emotional, romantic, career-related\\\\] at this stage of life and never got over it. The only thing I was good at was school. Nobody gives a shit about you if you are no trouble maker, just a moderately talented, extremly shy girl. I was so alone and disscociated I could talk to myself for hours.\\n\\nWe were poor so no fancy clothes, holidays, family activities or any experiences a normal teenager should have. My parents tried hard at that point, and I don't wanna blame them, but finally poverty got to them and they just destroyed their relationship and whole family. They have never taught me how to be a productive, active person with goals and a talent for earning money. I come home twice a year, for a day or two. I know they are hurt, but I am so sick of their yells and constant humiliation.\\n\\nRELATIONSHIPS\\n\\nI've been rejected by people I was in love with.  I am just too ugly, too weird, too shy. I confessed being bisexual to my parents and it was a living hell. I have never mentioned it again. My first and only relationship started when I was 23 - we're now engaged but I don't wanna get married \\\\[no money for it, too much anxiety over family issues, difficulties with taking responsibility and organizing anything, I literally cry when I think about it.\\\\] Simple, low-cost wedding is out of question - his family wants a real party. So we're getting nowhere, it just a stalemate.\\n\\nNow I have crushes for fictional characters and I still long for one person I was really infatuated with.\\n\\nI and my fiancee were happy but now I think I just desperately wanted to be with someone after my severe breakdown related to lack of any romantic relationship. I had no money, no chances for a job or place to live and I felt so unhappy and lost that he was a real savior. Wonderful man, true gentleman. He just doesn't know how to deal with my depression anymore and it starts to affect him. We are living together for over 5 years and I don't wanna end this as we do have so much in common and, let's face it, it's just easier for someone so severely depressed to be dependant. I know I am cruel, but without him I'd be long since dead.\\n\\nI do have some people who wanna see me and meet up but I no longer can catch up with them financially, emotionally, in terms of having a nice job, home, children. I don't wanna see their success as it only hurts me more.\\n\\nWORK/CAREER\\n\\nI am 30 years old, working in a shitty recruitment outsouring office I hate. I hate everything about this job and I can't change it. I tried to find a job for over 3 years after I finished my useless master degree and no luck. I tried applying my dream jobs, I tried to be a freelance copywriter, I tried to have a blog with some income. I just wasn't good enough for any of those and if not for my former colleague I would not be accepted here as well. I can't and don't want to be promoted as I barely stand my current duties.\\n\\nI am financially dependent on my fiancee as I would not be able to pay for my place without him. I earn very little comparing to my co-workers because I don't have strength, motivation and courage to ask for a raise or to constantly change jobs.\\n\\nGOALS\\n\\nAs mentioned above I have no career goals. Any other ones are just out of my reach. I feel like having a constant fatigue syndrome. Add social anxiety and travelling & going out is nearly impossible. I wish I could travel and see some world, but I cry and get scared off at the moment of booking plane tickets. I have actually been away for a few days and it was scary as hell, I came back so stresssed out.\\n\\nI wish I could have a home or an apartment but I don't have money. I'd love to be a housekeeper, to pick up decor, furniture, wall paint, to make a home. We are saving up for years and fucking prices just get up higher and higher. Every year our goal is getting further away. I live in a shitty, old, one room apartment and we can't even rent up something better because then we couldn't save cash anymore.\\n\\nI am 30 years old with little chances to get married or have a home so I gave up hope for a baby as well. We can't afford wedding and apartment, how can we afford a baby? After all I am a fucked up adult kid myself, how could I be a good mother for someone else?\\n\\nLOOKS/ Other issues\\n\\nI have no energy, no motivation, all I do for years is playing games in my free time. I can't force myself onto some sort of effort to do anything else. I tried some easy going sports, I gave up after a day or two. I got fat, and I have still not overcome my teenage insecurities. I hate my body as well which impacts my sex life and social life. I have never had an orgasm with my partner and I've stopped trying.\\n\\nI feel extremly weak, physically and mentally and I hear people telling me this as well. You're lazy, you are not resilient, you're neurotic. You want an easy life.  I have a perfectionist OCD.\\n\\nI am no longer surprised or disappointed when something in my life blows up. What did you expect, you stupid bitch? You're a failure, it's just another one. I wish I could reload my life as a different character. I've been living so long with depression, neuroses and anxiety that I don't want to know who I'd be without them. Definitely not myself.\\n\\nI have my first psychiatrist appointment within a few weeks and I hope he'll just give me meds that will make me indifferent. I hope I won't run away. It's fucking expensive but I decided either that or I will kill myself. He can't change my shitty life and I can't change it either.\",\n",

I’ve always had a high med tolerance so they would bump up the dose every few months until I was maxed. Then they switch me to another drug and start the process again. About 5 years ago I met my fiancée and things got better, but I couldn’t afford the antidepressants and antipsychotics anymore because I lost my Medicaid. I just started to smoke a lot of pot to keep the pain down. Now we’ve moved across the country and I’m away from my family and friends and I’m having a hard time meeting new people.

She didn’t like that I didn’t wear as much makeup as most women, or that the clothes I wear were usually black (even if I was dressed to the 9s), or that my home life revolves around family. She would pick those things apart and make me feel less than human because she had a different lifestyle and it really hurt my already damaged self image. I guess I’m just at a loss. I don’t know how to make it better. I don’t want to have to go back to the medication because I felt so lifeless but I’m not sure what to do to help. Therapy hasn’t really been much of a success in the past but maybe I should try again? Thoughts? I need help. A 3rd party opinion.',\n",

I was very hesitant at first but after a couple months of thinking and some desperation I agreed and put up the money for it. \\n\\nObviously that business failed and now I feel so stupid because it should have been common sense from the start going into a business with no prior knowledge about running one.

Even with cheap rent I knew it was only enough for a few months. And I couldn’t find another job within the first two months.

I'm a 35 year old hypothyroidism, clinically bipolar with episodes of social anxiety, manic depression, low energy, sometimes abnormally high energy male.  I have not let this stop me though.  For the most part I live a happy life with a girlfriend and 3kids. Shit... I have 3 kids.  Expensive little buggers they are but I love them. Christmas has me bankrupt.  And honestly a little worried. \\n\\nSo who am I though?  If you were to ask my gf she would say many things. Loving father,  god in bed, worried about everything I should be, energetic sometimes asshole, lazy, and depressing.  Wait, nevermind.  She would not say any of that.  She would say he is just him.  We love each other for who we are.  All of it the good and the bad.  And in that way I am lucky. \\n\\nIf I were to tell you how I feel I am.  I would say multiple people trapped in one body.  Multiple emotions fighting for attention trapped inside a brain who has no control over what emotion will win.   I wake up in the morning not knowing how I'll feel before bed.  I go to bed not knowing what the emotion wheel will land on in the morning.  I have learnt to mask the bad sides.  If anything for the kids.  And I do do that well.  But on the inside I really am a mess.  Will the kids eventually figure out my bluff.  Yes, I'm sure they will.  But, hopefully not till there old enough to handle it.  If there is such an age.  \\n\\nI do this all unmedicated.   Should I be on mood stabilizers?  That's a matter of opinion.  But like most of you.  I tired of the bullshit numb feeling that comes with it.   What is the point of not feeling the lows if it takes away the highs with it?  \\n\\nNow to the point.   How do I deal?  Again its all the small things.   Have you ever been depressed and got the will to take a hot shower.   Lather up and feel it run down your body as it washes up.   How about men out there.   Shaving.  Am I crazy?  Maybe.  But shaving.  The smell of the foamy cream.   The feel of a clean shaved neck.  No matter the mood.  I can always appreciate a good shave.  \\n\\nNo matter how much shit this world throws at us. How much like shit we feel.   Please find the small things.  Force yourself, no matter how hard it is to do anything.   Force yourself to do those small things you enjoy.   You may be surprised on how much better you may feel after.\\n\\nNOW BUY MY FUCKING BOOK.  It will make you rich.  Or me rich I forget.\\n\\n\\nPlease if life gets to hard and you think you will end it .  Seek help.  People are around.  Good people that don't judge.  You are worth everything.  No matter what bullshit the imbalances tell you.  \\n\\nHope you all had an at least ok Thanksgiving.  \\n\\nL3\",\n",

Once I got it situated the semester had already started at my uni, so I just decided to use their free counseling service for students. The huge downside was that scheduling just an intake appointment was such a hassle; the first time I called, the receptionist \"scheduled\" my appointment at the time that the office was going to be closed. I didn\\'t know until I walked in on the day of and the whole place was empty. After I tried a second time, I was able to successfully secure an appointment. Only this time, after I had finished, the therapist suggested that it would probably be best that I seek long-term care at a private practice outside of campus. Plus, their waitlist was weeks long. So I called the closest place that I live by, and they didn\\'t pick up. I left my name and number along with the reason I called, but I just never got a call back. I then decided to call a place that one of my family members went to, and this time I was able to get my name down on their waitlist. But that\\'s the thing; the lady on the phone told me that I may have to wait 3-4 weeks before they match me with someone for my intake. I know that technically I have a place that I\\'ll be going to already, but I can\\'t help but feel so frustrated.

I can’t make those deep friendships anymore because I feel like no one I know actually wants to ever see or talk to me, even before this whole virus shit.

When I was a lot younger, I would get super nervous around most people and resort to humor to break ice. Now i try to be funny all the time to make people like me, but now nobody really wants to get to know me beyond surface level bullshit that you would consider small talk. I can’t think of any of my friends who even know when my birthday is. I really feel alone.\\n\\nThen my family. They all really care about me, but any discussion about what I want to do with my life always turns ugly. Because I don’t know what I want anymore. I thought I did, but I can never motivate myself to do anything. I get surges of energy and then it’s gone for a long time. That’s how my life feels, waves of inspiration and the motivation to do something, then it’s gone. It always leaves so quickly. I think the worse thing is my parents never check on how I am mentally. They just complain that I don’t have a life goal like they do, and remind me that I need to figure shit out quick. I don’t think they have bad intentions, but I feel like my life priorities are so much different then theirs sometimes.\\n\\nNow here’s my biggest complaint. Every day, I feel like I am in a loop of bullshit. I eat, I work really hard to get As in school (this is the only reason my parents don’t just kick me out already because I am doing well in academics), then after I’ll once again pop an Adderall, waste time on some bullshit design or play around on FL and make some awful shit, get pissed and go to bed. That’s been my life the past couple years. I feel like I live two lives, one as a slave to bullshit I don’t care about at all, and me making an honest attempt at what I think I would love, and utterly failing. Both lives are reminders at how miserable I truly feel inside, and I go to bed feeling like that. I don’t really dream at all anymore, and I wake up so late for no reason.\\n\\nToday I really was at my end. I just kept thinking about how much of a failure I am, I sat on my second story windowsill and really thought about jumping. I think the biggest reason I never go through with self harm or suicide is because I know I haven’t done anything with my life yet, and I cling to the possibility that there is something for me. But every day it gets a little smaller, and it’s been shrinking for years.\\n\\nI think what really makes all of this shit bad is I don’t tell anyone about these thoughts or whatever it’s called. I hate thinking I’m depressed but I feel like I might be, despite what everyone thinks about me. I don’t know who to turn to anymore, to just sit down with someone and get everything off my chest. Because I really feel like anything I do or say to anyone, it just doesn’t matter. Nothing changes, I’m still stuck in this daily loop that I mentioned earlier. I feel very alone. At the same time I am scared of changes, and I don’t know why. I used to think I was special, that the things I would do or say matter, but as I get older I just realize how unspecial I truly am.

In middle school my first ever girlfriend broke up with me bc I was too scared to kiss her and she called me gay and laughed at me. In high school I went on a \"date\" with a girl I liked, which she said she was just doing for the hell of it and didn\\'t actually find me attractive, I wasn\\'t her type. For prom a girl agreed to go with me as a sympathy date, we had absolutely no physical contact, she told me she didn\\'t think of me that way, yet all the guys talked about her being slutty, even a few girls said the same thing. She was photographed giving a male stripper a blowjob. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME THAT MAKES ME SO FUCKING APPALLING?  I fucking hate my self, my body, my life, my pathetic existence. I don\\'t expect sex, I want it to be consensual, I want it to be special, I WANT TO BE WANTED. I\\'m in my 30\\'s and established as a fucking loser. I have no reason to continue living. Fuck this world, I can\\'t fucking stand it anymore.',\n",

There’s so much to live for yet it’s so easy to die at any moment. I don’t value life as much as some do, because why do we work so hard if all our achievements die with us? We figure out the answers to the questions we ask in life, yet die and forget them. Why do we try to accomplish a dream that’s farther then us? Why do we try and become popular amongst others, if we’ll all be forgotten at some point? I’ve never understood it. There’s no reason to value life as much if we’re all going to end up six feet under? Life is precious? I  can understand that but is it precious enough to give it your all then be forgotten like everyone else. If you work hard enough people will remember you? Sure, but those who remember you, all think differently.  If we never lived a life worth remembering, no one knows who you are. \\n\\nThat’s why life isn’t as precious as people think.',\n",

I've contacted a therapist to book an appointment so I'm trying to hold on till then. Today at school I was feeling so numb yet overwhelmed with emotions, I had the urge (and indulged) to self harm in the bathroom. I'm not proud of this.   \\nRight after the bathroom I remembered that Dorthy the therapy dog was visiting my Uni today so i stopped by the lounge to say hello - or rather just sit and watch everyone else interact with her. I wasn't expecting her to come right up to me and start licking my hands and face, I felt a mix of emotions all at once: comfort, unworthiness, hurt. I almost started crying right there lol, but there were people around so i held it together. She even put her paw on me when I tried composing myself, almost broke down again. I just felt so loved? When she was licking my hands it reminded me of what I just did, it almost felt like she knew and was trying to cheer me up. I've never told anyone truly what was/is going on in my mind, cause I'm able to just cover it up with a smile. Eventually I started petting her and calmed down a little, thanking her over and over. After she stepped away from me, i quickly left partly from embarrassment and to run to the bathroom to wash off my face & hands as I'm mildly allergic to dogs. I got one hive on my lip and mild itching, but having Dorthy help me is worth anything.   \\n\\n\\nGuess I'm sharing this to remind everyone that you're all very much capable of love and being loved, even if we dont feel like it. Dorthy helped me continue through my 7 hour class. Obviously my pain wont go away but doing small things like petting a dog, or having an acquaintance talk to me helps to distract me & add a little warmth to my life. Really grateful for my Uni for having these kinda services too. This is the one grey day in a plethora of dark ones.\",\n",

Hell, nobody even asks that question anymore, but you know what? Who cares anymore? The world has gone to shit and it's every man, woman, and child for him or herself. There will be those lucky few that get the proper help that they need, but others? We're given medicine in hopes that we won't use it for the worst things we can. I just need to talk. To be listened to and not feel like I'm the cause of other people's problems for once.\",\n",

Just started out with her sending adult pics to him. she had confessed for this and ask for apology and we tried to work on that. Sometime later she ended up having a drunken kiss with him which I found out about later. So I confronted her 3 weeks ago when I found out how far they had gone and ask her do you still love me? Do you want a divorce? And there she had a complete breakdown. She couldn\\'t handle what she had done, couldn\\'t handle that we needed to work on us. She packed up her stuff and left for his place. On her way out I gave her one thing to think about, \"if you sleep with him don\\'t come home.\"\\n\\nSo she doesn\\'t come home that night. She messages me in the morning and says I\\'m coming home to get my stuff. I tried to talk with her to work things out. She refuses to work on us at all. with her mental break it seems like she\\'s going through a manic episode. She went from person to person asking for comfort and support for what she did. Not even her best to friends of 15 years supported actions that she did. Her parents were appalled at what she decided. She can\\'t seem to recognize the lives in the friendships she\\'s ruined.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago she tried to have us do a counseling session. In the counseling session our first one, the counselor asked what we said on her intake paperwork. I said I wanted to work on reconciliation. and the first thing that came out of her mouth was I want a separate. Not I want to try to fix us, fix our problems with our help. But to get out of here. She was the woman who you may know that would skip from guy to guy when a relationship got too rough for them. When they didn\\'t know how to express themselves to work on their marriage. And this is what she did. We were married only one and a half years before she bailed. Just like her previous relationships.\\n\\nI\\'ve been sitting at home for almost a month now trying to figure out what I could have done what could have been different, what should she have done. But nothing is helping. I can\\'t help someone who refuses to help themselves. I love this woman with all of my heart, Body, Soul. And what she has done to me has been the worst thing I\\'ve ever experienced in my life. Trying to find something to hold me together, to make the days pass, without trying to just either want to make it end, or just find a way to make the pain stop. I\\'m constantly checking her Facebook to see if she has any new post. Obsessing over something of hers, all of our memories in the house we built. I don\\'t know what to do. I\\'m lost. I have people to talk to, I have people who will listen to my story. I even have people who agree with everything I\\'ve done, saying you\\'ve done nothing wrong, she\\'s not willing to work on you on your marriage.\\n\\nAns so I sit at home, alone where the last 4 years of my life I spent with the woman who I thought I was going to die with. The woman who I thought was going to be the end-all-be-all in my life and in hers. Now she\\'s run off with someone 20 years older than her so that she can get her jollies off and adventure in her life. I f****** hate her I f****** hate what she did to me. I f****** hate the lives she\\'s ruined, not just mine, but of the friends that we shared. The only ones that even know our close friends that we shared together, and our families. No one outside of that mutual family knows anything.

They were on amazon prime so I ordered it on a Friday and then woke up super early on Saturday to retrieve the package before my family got up. \\n\\nIt looked something like [this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0828/3109/products/Pipedream_Fuck_Me_Silly_Mega_Masturbator_Angle_View_right.jpg?v=1539623179) \\n\\nSo anyways I fucked the shit out of the thing like every other day, until I got lazy and stopped cleaning it. I had nowhere to hide it so I kept it in the giant cardboard box that it came in, and stored it in the back corner of my closet, with a giant ass blanket over it. Eventually I stopped using it so I sealed it shut with some tape\\n\\nNow fast forward like 1 year ago my mom goes into my room when I’m out of the house, and cleans out my entire closet because she was tired of it being so messy. She finds the box but doesn’t open it, she said to me that I should use a knife to cut the box up into small pieces, and put it into the recycling bin for garbage day. I said “okay okay” but never actually got around to doing it because i knew that I needed to keep the box in order to hide the sex toy. Eventually she got really mad with me and said if I don’t do it by next week, she’s going to do it herself while I’m at school. \\n\\nSo naturally i start panicking. I decided that I needed to get rid of the sex toy first before I got rid of the box. \\n\\nSo when my mom and my sister left to go to Hollywood for shopping, I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and began attempting to cut the sex toy up into small pieces. The thing smelt vile and foul, so I actually needed to use my dads gas mask he had in the garage to even be able to breathe properly (for people who don’t know, the thing had a large amount of rotten cum, and spit used as lube all stuck in the fuck canals, and it was left there for MONTHS). \\n\\nEventually I got everything cut up and evenly distributed the pieces into large black plastic garbage bags. By this time, my dad had gotten back from work, and my mom and sister were back. So I could not properly dispose of the sex toy pieces.\\n\\nThis thing was pretty big so I had like 3 bags full of the cut up pieces. I decided that my best bet at disposing of the bags without anyone noticing, was to get up early in the morning, around 2-3 AM, and go out and search for a dumpster to dispose of the bags. \\n\\nSo I decided to do just that. Each garbage bag was just big enough to fit inside my school backpack, so i needed to make 3 trips, there and back. See I live in a very populated part of Southern California, so even late at night, there were still people out, meaning I couldn’t really just leave the bag somewhere random and risk someone opening it and being disgusted by me, so I needed to find and travel to 3 separate dumpsters.\\n\\n\\nI set out on my bike (I couldn’t drive I was 16) at 2:45 AM with the first bag in my backpack and found a dumpster behind a mini plaza that was closed for the night. It was relatively close to my neighbour hood so I got rid of the first bag pretty easy. The second one, not so much. And the third bag I found myself biking almost across the city (and I basically lived in Los Angeles, so there were LOTS of people still on the street, and lots of hills) just to find a discrete area/dumpster to use. \\n\\nEventually I finished my 3 there and back trips from my house all the way out to some random dumpster at 3 AM. \\n\\nI was absolutely exhausted, but was relieved at the fact that I no longer had to worry about my mom finding the sex toy. \\n\\nWent through all of that trouble just for a few half decent nuts.

We were accepted into our first picks. The bad news? Our relationship was toast.  \\n\\n\\nWe decided we would enjoy whatever time we had left together, and then go our separate ways.

I can safely say I was the lucky one in our relationship. I’ve heard so many horror stories of crazy, manipulative boyfriends but Dean wasn’t like that at all. \\n\\n\\nHe was good. \\n\\n\\nSo a couple of months into university, when I heard he was dating another girl at his school, I wasn’t at all surprised. Dean was a charmer. Of course there was another girl lol. She was cute. I had only a few pictures to go off of on social media, but yeah. She very cute, very bubbly looking, and exactly the type of girl I had always imagined for Dean. \\n\\n\\nIn other words I was happy for them. \\n\\n\\nI mean, don’t get me wrong, I had my jealous moments … but I was mostly happy for them. The fact that I was suddenly thrust into university and forced to make new friends at school, helped to distract me from those tiny, unwelcome sparks of jealousy. I eventually wasn’t jealous anymore, and I eventually met this girl when Dean brought her home for Christmas. Our tight knit group of friends from high school had all met up at one of our houses the day before Christmas Eve. Dean politely introduced his girlfriend to me, and we got on really well. She was a nice person. Still is, as a matter of fact. (They’re married now and pregnant with their first child. Crazy, huh?)\\n\\n\\nThe next night, when I was with my family and a bunch of our relatives at my parents’ Christmas Eve party, I realized how much I missed home. School wasn’t too far away. Maybe two hours on a particularly busy day. But during those first few months, I tried my best not to go home and fall into old, comfortable habits. I wanted to grow up and separate myself from my family a little bit. That said, I absolutely cried when I saw them again. Such a cornball lol. My brother made fun of me for *years* over that. In fact he still does. He’s kind of an asshole like that, but in a good way.\\n\\n\\nSuffice to say I stuffed my face and immediately fell into food coma. It was close to midnight, I would say. I dragged myself into my old bedroom, where everything had been left the same since the last time I was there. The murmur of music and laughter down below kept me somewhat alert of my surroundings. I knew it wouldn’t be long before my mother or father came knocking to see if I wanted some extra dessert or something, so I told myself I would rest for only a few minutes. \\n\\n\\nThe second I flopped down in bed and sunk into the comfy mattress I been deprived of at school (seriously, the mattress in my dorm was like a slab of concrete) I felt my pocket vibrate.\\n\\n\\nI groaned into my pillow, lazily retrieving the flip phone from my pocket to find a text message. \\n\\n\\n*From: Nicky*\\n\\n*Merry Christmas* \\n\\n\\nHowever tired I felt, I smiled when I saw the message. \\n\\n\\nThere were times when we would go months without speaking, and times when we would speak nearly everyday. No matter how long we had gone without talking, we’d always pick up exactly where we left off as though no time had passed. \\n\\n\\nHe was going to school in the same city as me. But, for some reason, we had yet to hang out. We tried a few times in the beginning, organizing lunch or coffee somewhere in the city, but the plan would always change. We’d run into scheduling problems or papers that were due. For the most part, he was the one to cancel on me. I figured he wanted to focus on school and his new friends, which was totally cool with me as I was trying to do the same, but it kind hurt in this weird way. \\n\\n\\nThat in mind, I had no idea how to respond to his text. Truthfully I wanted to call him and catch up, figure out what he had been up to since September, but I resisted the urge and instead sent a very short, very prompt, ‘*You, too*’. \\n\\n\\nA few seconds later, he texted me again. \\n\\n\\n*From: Nicky*\\n\\n*Do you have time to talk?* \\n\\n\\nI wasn’t sure what to make of that, so I just stared at it for a moment or two, wondering if he was serious. For those past four months, he had canceled on me a total of twelve times. I had no idea what he could possibly have wanted to talk about, yet the curious part of my brain simply refused to subside until I said *Yes*. \\n\\n\\nIn no time at all, he called and I answered. \\n\\n\\nI figured there would be a moment of preamble but there wasn’t. He went straight for the jugular. \\n\\n\\nThe conversation went something like this:\\n\\n\\n“Hey, <insert name>, sorry for catching you at such a weird time, I just …” \\n\\n\\n“You just?” \\n\\n\\n“I … miss hanging out.” \\n\\n\\n“(raises eyebrow) You miss ‘hanging out’?”\\n\\n\\n“ … With you. I miss you.” \\n\\n\\n“Oh.” \\n\\n\\n“Yeah … Sorry for saying that out of nowhere. I’ll go. You’re probably busy and …” \\n\\n\\n“Wait, no. I miss you, too.” \\n\\n\\n“You do?” \\n\\n\\n“Of course. I’ve been trying to see you for months, smartass.”  \\n\\n\\n“(laughs) Right, yeah. Sorry for cancelling so much.” \\n\\n\\n“It’s okay. We’re not kids anymore. We can’t just hang out whenever we want, I guess.” \\n \\n\\n“What about now?” \\n\\n\\n“You want to hang out now?” \\n\\n\\n“Yeah. If I floor it I can probably make it over there in twenty minutes.” \\n\\n\\n“(hesitates) Your family wouldn't be upset if you ditched them on Christmas Eve?” \\n\\n\\n“I have feeling they’d encourage me to see you.” \\n\\n\\n“Um … Okay, cool. Take your time and be safe, though. Don’t floor it. The roads are crazy.”\\n\\n\\n“I’ll try not to.”\\n\\n\\nIn a matter of seconds I was up, pacing my bedroom. I would cast a look on the window now and then to see if he had arrived, but there were no headlights and no sign of him on the road ahead. I figured the roads were covered in snow, slowing him down a lot, and then I began to worry that he *had* actually floored it and landed himself in an accident. For a hot second I contemplated calling his mother to check when he had left relative to how much time had gone by. \\n\\n\\nThe moment I grabbed my phone to do so, I felt it vibrate in the palm of my hand. In about two seconds, I grabbed my coat and snuck out of the house undetected, leaving a tiny trail of footprints in the snow as I hopped over to the beat-up Honda Civic parked along the curb. To my great relief he had cranked the heat up, bringing a flush of warmth to my cheeks as I climbed inside. \\n\\n\\nHe looked much the same as the last time we had seen each other. Except now he was dressed for winter instead of summer. The fact that we hadn’t hung out since August had really begun to sink in. \\nThere was a moment of silence after I climbed in, a moment wherein eye contact was scarce and the faint hum of ‘How Soon is Now?’ by The Smiths was playing in the background. \\n\\n\\nNicky was a big fan of them. \\n\\n\\nI fell into the quiet of the song before darting a look at him, asking: “So, how have you been?”\\n\\n\\nHe told me he was doing well. He told me film school was better than he thought it would be and that he was learning a lot in his classes. I was happy for him. When we were kids we always used to re-enact scenes from our favourite television shows (Power Rangers, Ninja Turtles, etc.) and I distinctly remember calling him bossy a few times. Had I known his passion was to be a director, I would have encouraged the bossiness a little more and given him the Oscar performance he had always demanded of me, haha. \\n\\n\\nNeedless to say I was very proud of him. \\n\\n\\nOnce we covered the basics (school, part-time jobs, our nonexistent lovelives, friends and family, etc.) we reached a roadblock. Figuratively. \\n\\n\\nThere was nothing else to say, no words to fill in those wide stretches of silence. \\n\\n\\nI remember glancing up ahead at my parents’ house. The Christmas lights were on and the blinds were open, revealing the tree my mother had decorated weeks prior and the various silhouette of all the party guests. They were all in the living room, laughing and drinking, having a good time. \\n\\n\\nSoon enough he darted a look in my direction and uttered the inevitable: “You should go inside. Your parents are probably wondering where you are.” \\n\\n\\nHe was right. There was a party going on and yet, I didn’t care. I hesitated a moment, eventually asking: “Do you want to come in for a bit?”\\n\\n\\nI could see the flicker of surprise in his eyes and the debate that soon followed. \\n\\n\\nWithout saying anything, he followed me out of the car and through the front door of the house. I kicked off my winter boots and bobbed my head around the corner to make sure one of my nosy relatives weren’t looking, before leading the way. We tiptoed up the stairs and into my room, the bed covers still ruffled from when I had collapsed on top of them after dinner. \\n\\n\\nI took my coat off and hung it up, back facing Nicky as he hovered quietly by the door. We left it open an inch or two, just enough that we could hear it if someone approached. There was really no reason to be so covert and sneaky. My family liked Nicky. In fact my mother had asked me to invite him to the party anyway, but I told her, he was probably busy with his own family. \\n\\n\\nYet there he was, in my room. \\n\\n\\nTo my memory it was his first time up there. The few times he had come to my house when we were kids, my parents made us play in living room or in the backyard where they could keep an eye on us. We weren’t allowed to go up to the second floor of the house alone. \\n\\n\\nIn a matter of seconds he was studying his new surroundings. The colour of the walls, the photos tacked onto the bulletin board, the books lined neatly along the shelf, *everything*. \\n\\n\\nThe moment he spotted Twilight in my collection, he chuckled.\\n\\n\\nI tried to play it off like one of my friends bought it for me, but damn it, I was into that series and I’m no longer ashamed to admit it, lmao. \\n\\n\\nShortly thereafter the atmosphere grew less tense. In that time he texted his mother and told her he was going to hang out at my house for a bit longer. She had apparently started dating, and her boyfriend’s two teenaged kids were at the house, too, as well as Angela and her fiancee. So their house wasn’t completely empty without Nicky. I was very happy for his mother. She deserved a good man in her life, and according to her son, the new guy was very nice. \\n\\n\\nWe eventually went downstairs together, as there was no point in hiding up in my bedroom like a couple of high schoolers. I introduced him to a few of my relatives. They, of course, mistook him for my boyfriend at first, but I immediately corrected them. My parents greeted him warmly, and my brother shook his hand, offering a drink. For obvious reasons Nicky declined. First, because he was still underage. Second, because he had driven there and the roads were bad enough. \\n\\n\\nWe hung out in the main room for a bit, and then we slipped into the kitchen to munch on some snacks and indulge in some nonalcoholic beverages. Well … Nicky went nonalcoholic. I, on the other hand, went straight for the wine. \\n\\n\\nOne glass. \\n\\n\\nNothing crazy. \\n\\n\\nIt was a lot quieter in the kitchen, and there was a nice view through the window. Even though it was cold and snowing outside, we decided to go out onto the back porch and (both literally and figuratively) chill out there for a few minutes. Again, it was a lot quieter. The music and laughter from the party had almost completely escaped our senses as we closed the door behind us, sitting down on the porch swing side-by-side. \\n\\n\\nI won’t lie to you guys. \\n\\n\\nThere was some tension, an undercurrent that we had both ignored for a very long time. Perhaps that was the reason he had cancelled on me so often, because maybe he was trying to avoid what was so plainly obvious. He had that right. Yes, we shared an intense history, and for that reason, we understood each other on a level that other people couldn’t but we had already talked through the painful memories of our past, so what the fuck? Why couldn’t we just be friends? Why was it always so complicated? \\n\\n\\nYes, it had occurred to me that maybe there were some feelings there. I had no idea if they were romantic, I just knew we couldn’t move forward in our friendship without addressing them. The timing could have been better, but I had no idea when the next time would be so I just went for it. Luckily I had a glassful of liquid courage at my disposal. \\n\\n\\n“Nicky, do you like me?” \\n\\n\\n“Of course.” \\n\\n\\n“No, not that way. I mean, do you *like-like* me?” \\n\\n\\n“(bursts out laughing) What the fuck. Are you serious?” \\n\\n\\n“(embarrassed) Uh, okay. You don’t have to be a dick about it. I was just asking.”\\n\\n\\n“(laughs) Sorry. I didn’t mean to be dick.”\\n\\n\\n“Whatever. If you don’t *like-like* me then why have you been avoiding me?”\\n\\n\\n“Well, first of all, I never said no to *like-liking* you.” \\n\\n\\n“So, you do *like-like* me?”\\n\\n\\n“Do you want me to *like-like* you?”\\n\\n\\n“Is that your backwards way of asking if I *like-like* you?”\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know. Do you?”\\n\\n\\n“I don’t know.”\\n\\n\\nIt was a whole lot of that, and a whole lot of dancing around the truth before I decided *fuck it*, and kissed him. First on the cheek and then on the lips when he turned his head. It wasn’t a super intense, movie kiss, mind you lol. It was pretty awkward to be honest. I didn’t know where to put my hands or how long I should kiss him for and he was just as befuddled. \\n\\n\\nThat said, it was a nice kiss. \\n\\n\\nI liked it, and judging by the fact that he kissed me again almost immediately after I pulled away, I’m pretty sure he liked it, too lol. \\n\\n\\nNaturally there was a layer of reluctance. With regards to intimacy, he’s always had his troubles and I’ve always had mine, and it wasn’t always easy working through those troubles. \\n\\n\\nSo, yes, to all the people who’ve been asking, *we are in a relationship*. Haha. I had initially set out to include this in Part 2 of the story, but I guess I thought people wouldn’t believe me? Let’s be real. Our story is pretty crazy even without all of this. Basically, we kissed a lot that night and toyed with the idea of being together, but we ultimately decided it was wiser to take some time to live a little and enjoy university. So, that’s what we did. We went to different parties, dated other people, took part in study abroad programs (him in London and me in Seoul) and then, when those four years were up, we did exactly as I mentioned earlier. \\n\\n\\nWe picked up exactly where we left off. \\n\\n\\nInsane, right?\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       " 'I’m posting this here because I just want to know if anyone else feels this way. I’m not lazy! I know it looks like I’m lazy. I sleep all day, I never join the family to eat or watch a movie, I spend all of my time in my room. I failed my classes, although I used to get straight A’s. I never go out anymore, I haven’t hung out with any of my friends in months. I don’t even walk my dogs. Or at least that’s just what it looks like right?\\n\\nI’m not lazy. I hate it here. I’m miserable, my mind is in constant pain. Everything feels so heavy and difficult. Why do I have to participate in a life that just causes me so much pain? Why do I have to get a job, when doing so causes a massive downward spiral in my mental health? Why do I need to keep going to school when it makes me feel totally and utterly filled with dread and fear? Other people want me here more than I do. \\n\\nI feel like most people are given a shiny, fun, new toy, and some of us are given old dusty broken shit from the thrift store. And they wonder why we won’t just “play with it, live a little, have fun! Be happy with what you’ve got! Enjoy it!”  Like, I’m sorry for hating it. I’m sorry for hating my life. I’m sorry my brain doesn’t do shiny, fun, cool things, and it resembles the broken toy a bit more. People who have never experienced serious mental health issues have no idea what it’s like for us. If their toy gets a scratch, they can polish it. My toy is way too broken to even bother trying to polish it. It’s so invalidating and exhausting to even exist near people who don’t understand because I can feel the constant judgement. \\n\\nWhen normal people feel sad, they can watch a movie or call a friend to cheer themselves up. And it genuinely works for them. I can’t escape the brokenness of my mind even when I’m “happy”. It’s always there, and I can always feel it no matter what. Lately, the weight has been too heavy to bear. So I know it looks like it, but I promise I’m not lazy. I’m just trying to stay afloat.',\n",

       " 'My brother committed suicide on April 6, 2019. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a Saturday and I went out early in the morning with my friend to go help her find her prom dress. I was 15 years old at the time and, Yeah, I’m a guy, but I also have good taste. Anyways, I spent most of the day with her and I eventually came back home at around 5 pm. My mom made some crawfish (one of my favorite seafoods) and I ate a bunch when I got home. Eventually, my mom came home with groceries and things. I got him a vans jacket (we already had it but for some reason they left the alarm thing on it) and my mom went to go check up on him and give him the jacket. Meanwhile, I was outside getting all the groceries. Suddenly, I heard my mom scream like I never heard before. I dropped the groceries and ran inside to my brothers room. There was blood on his bed, the floor, and part of the walls. The smell was something that I never smelt before, it was absolutely terrible. My mom kept shaking my brother. And I had to call the police. The operator was asking if he had a pulse and I kept saying no. The operator kept saying to go check but I just knew. I also had to make sure that my little sister didn’t see any of this. I actually remained very calm because I knew that any amount of distress and the situation would be worst. I had to be there for my mom and my sister at the time. The police came around 5 minutes during the call. Multiple cops actually showed up and an ambulance. My mom was still covered in his blood and explaining to the police what happened. She thought he was playing at first but realized that something was extremely wrong. My whole family came rushing to the house. I had to explain to my sisters that I wasn’t joking and this isn’t a prank and that my brother actually shot himself in the head. The police didn’t leave till 10:30 pm that night and I didn’t even want to sleep in my room much less the house. I slept at my older sisters house that night, and the night after that, and the week after. My room is right next to his so it took me awhile till I could actually sleep in my room again.\\n\\nMoving on to the future, it turns out he was already announced deceased about 30 minutes prior to me getting to the home. The thought of him being deceased while I was home and me not knowing was terrifying. We didn’t really talk so I honestly didn’t know. The doctors told us that the bullet didn’t come out the other side and was stuck inside his head. They told us that he became a vegetable before he passed so he didn’t feel anything. Thank god. My brother was in band at school. The whole band came together and help the go fund me to pay for his funeral. It worked, we successfully paid for everything. Ever since everything, everyone obviously hasn’t been the same.\\n\\nThe reason why I’m writing this is that, it isn’t worth committing suicide. People are worth it and you are worth it. You belong on this earth for a reason. The pain that this had caused to my family won’t go away after awhile, maybe never. You can get through all of this.

       " \"Hi guys,\\n\\nMy name’s Phil, and I'm an 18 years old male. I’ve never done anything like this before. But, I thought it could help at least one person (maybe even myself) so I’m going to give it a try. Here’s the story of my years-long battle.\\n\\nI would consider my life up until the age of four to be quite normal; I was good at making friends, I had a very childish “romance” with a girl at preschool, and I lived in a stable household. It was on my fourth birthday where my life started to tread downhill. My parents had invited my best friend from preschool over to my house for my birthday party. From what I remember, the party was quite swell. I had cake and such and such, typical party. After it was over, my best friend invited me to spend the night at his house. I begged my parents, and they conceded. I ate dinner there and we were soon sent to bed (if you find it hard to read about molestation, skip to the next paragraph. I’m going to be very frank about my experience). Now, before I continue, I must say that I still think about this night vividly on occasion 14 years after it happened, and it makes me sick to my stomach every time. It has become harder and harder to make out all the details with the passing years, but how it felt is still engraved into my brain. It has made me feel like less of a man, and very much like a tool made to be used. Well, here I go. After we entered our respective beds, my friend says he wanted to try something on me that his father had done to him. I agreed. I had absolutely no clue what he meant, but next thing I knew he had put himself into my bed and did exactly what he said he would do. The same thing his father had done to him. I refuse to go into more detail for both my and your sake. After this point, it was a blur. I remember telling my mother about it and that’s about it.\\n\\nAfter that night I had never felt the same. \\n\\nA year passed and I had enter elementary school. I didn’t have the same ability I once had to make friends with other kids. This was the beginning of my ostracization. As the years increased, so did my weight. By the end of elementary school, I weighed roughly 210lb. The increase continued into middle school where I hit a max, of I believe, 270lb. I hated myself, I was fat, friendless, and most importantly, loveless. At this point, my parents’ marriage was starting to show cracks. There was constant fighting. These fights primarily were a result of my half-sister who at the time was a heroin addict (I believe she has now recovered, but I don’t know for sure). I started to grow angry at this time. Very angry. Angry at the world, my parents, and myself. I hated everything. I was very eager to start fights and to stick it to people. I remember physically assaulting a number of people that I would have considered friends because they caused me the slightest annoyance, specifically one boy, I hit multiple times. I have never said sorry to any of these people (if you happen to read this, I’m very sorry). I probably hurt them greatly and ruined their trust in others.\\n\\nThis anger lasted until high school where it turned into competitiveness. After developing this personality trait, I lost 100lb, which reinforced it. I had to win everything. If I didn’t, I would break down. I’ve famously punched many walls, leaving many dents. As you can probably imagine this wasn’t healthy. This level of competitiveness slowly turned into sadness. With everything I mentioned up until now: my inability to make friends, my anger, my competitiveness, and my unattractive physical appearance I was one of the most hated individuals within my school. My very complicated personality mixed with my standing with my peers led to depression. I became very depressed during my junior year of high school. I was having very bad depressive episodes every night. It started to noticeably affect my school work (at this time I was fourth in my class out of 110), I felt like I had to work even harder to maintain what I had, all I had, which was my grades. To make things worse, this is when my parents got divorced. To be frank, I didn’t cry, I didn’t care. After developing my weird personality, my parents had no value to me, but it still worsened my depression.\\n\\nOn a day, during the November of 2018, I tried to kill myself (if you have a hard time reading about suicide, skip to the next paragraph). This is something, just like my molestation, I have a very hard time talking about, so I’m going to keep it brief. I had decided to live with my father after the divorce, and he had a 9mm in his bedroom closet. On a day that he was off on business, I decided I was going to do it. I didn’t even write a note, I didn’t want to be remembered, I wanted to be silent. I remember loading it and putting it to my head. I sat there, and I sat there. Eventually, my mind brought me to this girl who had been very kind to me over the last year and how sad she would be if this was the route I took. So I put the gun down, and I cried.\\n\\nNow, a year and a half later, here I am. I’m now on 20mg of Lexapro after my doctor noticed my depression. I still experience depressive episodes now and then (a lot more recently because of the coronavirus outbreak). I’m now getting prepared to go to my dream college, and I feel like I have some semblance of control in my life. There is a lot I didn’t talk about in this, including my experiences with alcohol abuse and my personal relationship with the girl that in essence stopped my suicide, but I didn’t want to make this too long. Now that all is pretty much said and done, what advice can I give? \\n\\n-Live for the dreams you’ve yet to see materialize.\\n\\n-Live for the people you haven’t met that you’ll make smile.\\n\\n-And, given the aforementioned, live the life you want. Live the dreams *you* want, and make the people *you* want to smile. \\n\\nI hope this shows at least one person that they are not alone. If you think no one cares about your situation, I do. Thanks for reading this.\\n\\nPost: I wrote this at 3am. If there’s any errors, I’ll fix them in the morning. I’m sorry if it’s all over the place, I’m very bad at writing about myself. If you want to reach out to me and ask questions, feel free. Thanks again for reading this. I encourage anyone who has been through depression to post their story as well, there are many people hurting in the world right now.\\n\\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for the kind words. I’m happy to hear that some of you have taken inspiration from my story. That makes me extremely happy!\",\n",

We used to text all throughout the day, but now he only replies when I ask something.\\nToday he said my being constantly insecure was getting on his nerves. I asked if he would prefer me to lie. I don’t want to have to hide how I feel from him. Especially since at the beginning of our relationship we didn’t really hide things. He said “it’s just extra drama I don’t need”. I’m not going to lie, when I read that it crushed me inside. And I totally understand it, but I thought I had found someone who would be there for me. I’m so tired of people not wanting to deal with my sadness. My friends don’t want to deal with it, my family doesn’t either, and now I let someone into my heart just so they could reject my feelings too. I feel like I give so much to the world but it keeps getting thrown back in my face. I don’t want to be insecure, but I am.\\n\\nBefore I found him I was so lonely. I’m scared to death to go back to that. It was so isolating, and  the memory of being that lonely haunts me. It tears me to my knees and makes me hate myself all over again. I can’t go back to that.\\nIt just hurts me to think he doesn’t want to deal with my sadness. No one does. It hurts to think that my boyfriend views my pain as “extra drama”. I think I need to back off a little and give him some space. But when I can’t confide in him I feel just as isolated as before. I don’t want to lose him, so I think I  will hide my emotions. I have to, or I’ll be alone again. \\n\\nI’m just so sick of constantly feeling like my sadness is a burden on the people around me. I’m trying to change, I just need time',\n",

       " \"I’m 29/m and the last two years been a lesson to me, about friendship and being honest about my feelings, even though I’m still far from being where I want to be and probably never will be.\\n\\nIt all started about 2 years ago. I started to work in a call center, and I was still together with my long-term relationship (girl from another country, for 7 years). In this new job I met a really attractive girl called Janet who really was on the same level as me, I’m normally a real introvert person and it felt so good to be able to talk with someone and specially a girl in this way. We were laughing and talking during our breaks and later on been calling each other as the time went by.\\n\\nMeanwhile my long-term relationship was over, because of other reasons, she moved from another country to be with me but realized she isn’t happy here. It was and is no big deal for me, we are still friends and everything about it is fine.\\n\\nSo a period of partying, festivals and enjoying single life started for me after 7 years of being in a relationship, left some things to catch up. I never thought once about trying it with that Janet from work, we were always talking about what she was looking for in a relationship and what I am looking for, in the beginning she never sent me any signals. And over nearly a whole year it went on like this.\\n\\nBut after a few months something happened which made the whole story difficult. I met another girl called Nicole at our Christmas party (Janet didn’t go as she was ill), same department … we started to date, but one bad date followed the next, after like 10 months we got together (in between a long break) but I never felt this connection with her like I did with Janet. I always struggled with the situation because I knew she isn’t the one. But the time went on and we got along.\\n\\nI still met with Janet in our breaks and we went on calling each other and texting, but always in a friendzone way, but talking about very intimate stuff too. We were always talking about the relationship with Nicole in a funny way that she isn’t the one for me and when will I finally break up with her, but I just slowly I realized that Janet was serious about it.\\n\\nAfter another few months I finally made the decision to tell Nicole the truth that I don’t love honestly and want to break up. It was the worst feeling to break someone’s heart like this. It took me weeks to get used to it.One weekend I met with Janet and we had a really nice day together sightseeing a castle and talking and laughing the whole day.But at work things with Nicole became difficult, I saw her nearly every day at work and one day after about three weeks she confronted me and was crying in front of me asking me back. I became weak and after a while we got back together.\\n\\nThe thing is that I told Janet about the breakup and it made her happy, but back then I had no clue that she had more feelings for me…. When I told her about getting back with Nicole it broke her heart…\\n\\nThis went on for another few months, things changed, me and Janet didn’t talk anymore, and this fact made me really unhappy. Until things with Nicole went weird, she was always jealous about me talking to colleagues at work or when she found out that I was talking/texting with Janet in the past. I told her the thing with Janet is nothing and she forgave me.\\n\\nBut the next breakup with Nicole was just a matter of time, after the next Christmas party, when I was talking to all kinds of colleagues, she confronted me in front of everyone and I left. This was the moment I thought enough is enough. I told Nicole I break up now definitely and start a clean sheet and did he decision that I need to make things work with Janet again.\\n\\nI was afraid to talk to Janet, so I wrote a long text message, the longest I ever did. Basically, that I know now what I want, that I should have never risked our friendship and I feel like I’m just as bad as any other man and I will never forgive myself about what I did but I need to talk with her.Well, she replied with a voicemail which today still hurts me to think about, she told me that I will always be this way, that I hurt her a lot and she doesn’t want to give it another try with me.\\n\\nI replied that I’m really sad about it and that I had the best time with her …\\n\\nBack then I didn’t want to seem like an idiot and didn’t text her again.\\n\\nThis happened in December. Nearly 4 months later, I’m back together with Nicole. I can’t stop thinking about what a mistake I did with Janet and that I will never find a friend like her again and probably I would have had the best relationship with her. Nearly every day I think about breaking up with Nicole as it doesn’t feel right. And I know it’s not fair that I’m not honest to her about my feelings. Most of the days I have fun with Nicole as well, but it hurts me that I can’t love her the way I should and that I can’t stop thinking about Janet, even though she probably moved on already and doesn’t waste a thought on me.\\n\\nI don't know what to do to get over it, I just with everything would be the other way ...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSideinfo:\\n\\nJanet doesn’t work at that workplace anymore since last year October, so I don’t see her anymore and know what she is up to … every day I think about texting her and hoping that it could be all the way it was before but I can’t ignore the fact that she told me that it’s over between us.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate 12th April\\n\\nWell things took a fast turn in my story here - 3 days ago Nicole went through my stuff and found this post. From one moment to the other everything changed, shouting and crying started, I froze and couldn't explain properly what was going on, just that it's the truth. Not long after she left my place and since then I didn't hear anything of her anymore.\\n\\nIt's different than the times before as now I know that there is no way back anymore, what I did to her was horrible and god probably she won't be able to trust any man anymore. The last weeks we've been together 24/7 because of social distancing and working from home. We got along well actually and now that we broke up I feel like it's been all a big mistake, that I miss being together and having our days the way they were. I know she really tried her best in the last months and she was talking about all the things we should be doing and planning our future.\\n\\nI wish there would be an easy way to be happy again, I guess it will take a really long time.

You all know how it is. \\n\\nI've attempted suicide once when I was 11 or 12..thought 9 1500mg Tylenol would do the trick 🙄 I felt like a prisoner in my own head and at home. I got tired of the pain and mental abuse and took them. Literally nothing happened. \\n\\nI confided in a friend at school about it because I always had thoughts of doing it again. The school counselor was called about it, so I was in her office. She had already called my parents about it. I talked to her about why I did it and what I thought would happen.\\n\\nWhen I got home that day, my mother sat on her bed crying her eyes out asking why I would try to do anything like that. I told her exactly what was going on with the mental abuse from home on top of school bullying and how years of that can get in your head and something just snaps in your head where you start to believe it. The daily hurt and not wanting or having the energy to leave your bed.  She promised to get me help and that things would change.\\n\\nNothing ever changed. Life at home steadily got worse and worse, but I never fully attempted to end my life again. The thought was always there, even on a good day. Always lurking around the corner to strike you down. \\n\\nI've been a frequent visitor in the school counselor's office since that day, I wasn't offered actual help, but I also didn't want my mother being in legal trouble for someone else's actions either. After a while, I just figured if I've survived this long without being medicated or having a therapist, why bother someone about it now? \\n\\nI deal with it by isolating myself when it gets too bad.

Some have support and people they can reach out to for support but some of us don't or just don't want to feel like a burden to our families, which is why a lot of us are here. \\n\\nThe whole point of this post wasn't to bring anyone down, but to show that no one is alone in this scattered mess. We all have demons inside pulling at us, trying to break us, but we're still here! There's usually something or someone keeping us here and sane  for the most part.\\n\\nI've always turned to strangers on the internet to vent, talk, whatever when I felt like getting everything off my chest to try to ease my mind and thoughts, and ended up making some really good friends along the way. \\n\\nI just wanted to let you all know that if you EVER need someone to reach out to for support to keep going, I am here for you guys. I'll listen, I'll care, and I'll do everything in my power to help the best I can. \\n\\nI work nights during the week, so if you can't sleep, I'm your man.

I currently attend park center senior high school... \\n    I\\'m here to tell my story and hopefully get some insight into my life and hear your opinions. \\n    \\tLast year I confessed to my parents that I think I have anxiety. I realized this while doing some research on how I feel living life over the 2018 summer. even then I wasn\\'t sure but I figured she should know because it would start affecting,y daily life. I would always have a high heart rate even know I\\'m a runner.\\n    \\tWhen I went in for my doctor\\'s appointment I took that GAD (general anxiety disorder) she later came back and basically said I have severe anxiety with a mild depressive episode. She started me on 20mg of Fluoxetine, the normal starting dose for kids. So after a while, I noticed that these meds were effecting me differently, my friends were asking if I was okay because they say \"I seem different\". I didn\\'t feel different at the time but I thought about it for the next few days. I noticed I was ALWAYS tired. I was never motivated to do anything. I would be the guy to watch my friends do something really fun and be happy for them, but I would be in the corner.\\n    \\tSo I started taking double my dose after I researched if my body could handle it. (max dose of fluoxetine is 80mg). so I was taking 40mg of fluoxetine per day) now the doc told me it might cause some tiredness so I always took it at night. after a little while of 40mg, I was still fucked up. I was getting more and more depressed and less and less anxiety. I was getting suicidal and had my phase with self-harm. \\n    \\tSo recently (maybe a month or 2) ago I asked my mom to make a 2nd appointment for my mental health. after conversing with my doctor about how I feel and telling her I\\'ve been taking double the dose, she said that we were gonna keep my dose off fluoxetine with 40mg per day to control the anxiety, and introduce a small dose of Wellbutrin to help with the depression. now Wellbutrin was supposed to perk me up a little and not be tired, so I had high hopes.\\n    \\tAfter a little while on these new drugs (again, month or so) I notice that I am experiencing terrible anxiety when I\\'m at school and as soon as I get home, I\\'m fine for like an hour then I just get incredibly depressed. it\\'s been bad. \\n    \\tI\\'ve tried to keep my head up and not fall back down so I\\'ve researched \"safer\" ways to cause my body harm and still get the pain I need. things like snapping a rubber band on my wrist to the point where it is red and swells up, and also sticking ice on my wrist and leaving it there, this causes pain to the arm and can \"burn\". (yes, an ice burn is a thing). \\n    \\tI\\'ve just been really pissed with the school system lately too because they really teach us the least important shit that we will never use. like yeah, i get they are teaching us to learn but teach us with the important stuff. like I\\'m mature enough, I can learn about taxes and mortgages and stuff. I need that extra challenge to keep me busy, but with my anxiety, my grades do not represent my smarts, so I stay in lower-level classes bored and depressed. I mean you might even be able to tell I\\'m smarter by the way I write this letter. I\\'m in 9th grade... cmon now.\\n    \\n    What should I do? I\\'m going to the doc in 2 weeks. what should I tell her?\\n    Thank you all, I really appreciate it.\\n    -Nick',\n",

       " 'Hi all! I just stumbled on this subreddit. I think its great for us to be able to express ourselves freely and help each other out in a forum like this. \\n\\nLately, especially the past 2 months or so, have been so rough for me mentally. I suffer from general anxiety and depression a lot, (obviously), and due to my substance abuse (specifically LSD, MDMA, and marijuana) these illnesses have been amplified to a next degree. I began to suffer from mental illness, especially social/general anxiety, at fairly young age (15-16). I was already super awkward in coversations but recently (i am 21 years old) it got worse. Due to my childhood trust issues and lack of self confidence, i began spend time with friends who curious in taking drugs, essentailly not the best influences due to my current state and this further decreased my self confidence bc i became addicted to some and used others far too frequently. Relationships with friends began to suffer because during our “trips” on LSD and even MDMA i would go into teribble thought loops of pure negativity. And no one enjoys that person on a trip. I wouldnt be able to have a conversation with someone bc of how in my head i was, and this would even lead me to not being able to help my own friends when they are having their own anxiety attacks bc i would know what to do. I would be stuck in a mode of panic and terror. My friends do not take this lightly and i know this. I feel selfish and gross for not being able to be there to help them bc of my own condition. I continued to try to get myself out but always found a way to give up getting out of the thought loop bc it was so difficult and my brain would race a million miles a minute. After continued uses of these substances over a span of 2-3 years, my depression and anxiety increased, ultimately bc of the psycological torture i would put myself through with these thoughts loops and anxiety attacks i would get. I would come to the most radical conclusions about myself, essentially going too deep down the rabbit hole. During an LSD trip i dove down into a deep rabbit hole of exsistential terror and depression in which I came to my ultimate low. My rabbit hole dove so deep that i questioned my own sexuality bc i thought a woman would never want to be with a piece of shit like me and that there is no hope. This led to my ultimate demise bc this questioning of my own being led me to become more socially awkward/anti social...to the point of not trusting my friends anymore and becoming very internally dominated when out in public/social environments and it has made conversations and interactions the most difficult it has ever been, even with close family. My friends began to tell me that maybe i am gay/bisexual bc of that conclusion i went to. But this never sat well with me and never felt right in my gut bc i have been straight all my life and have had girlfriends and sexual relationships as well. I was always socially awkward. I knew this conclusion arose due to my lack of self confidence and depression/anxiety making me draw the most radical conclusion. I began to build jelously and resent in myself bc of my lack of self confidence, anxiety and drug abuse. I always find myself overthinking, and analyzing everything. My friends have noticed this and have started treating me differently due to my vulnerability, such as not paying me back money they owed me for a while, treating/indirectly calling me stupid and childlike for what i have done (such as not being there during their anxiety attacks and general negative thinking) , etc.  \\n\\nSo this is my current condition. Heavily anxious, anti-social, and even more socially awkward. I find that i judge myself/others a lot, so i can start there by stopping the judging by simply being more observant and listening more than being interally dominated bc i know that creates negative patterns. However, a huge demon i am still fighting is the hormone monster, to put it in the most simplist of terms. Because of that one LSD trip when i questioned my sexuality bc of hopelessness, my anxious mind has not shut that door yet, mostly bc i have been in a dry spell with woman for quite some time now and my testosterone is high, essentially the darker side of my mind opens doors to “every sexual oppurtunity” even though i favor women.  It is just that i have not had much experience with women and i always get really nervous when talking to them... maybe i have to try and not sexualize them as much and just have normal conversation.This drives me to have immense social anxiety with both men and women and leads me to eventually isolate myself from all interactions, including with friends and family. Thank you for reading this whoever you are! You are a champ! And any advice/thoughts are appreciated. Love you all!\\n\\nEDIT: my friends also indirectly hint at me that i DONT want things to be better, and that i am a “cancer”.  They always say shit that has double meaning and they laugh amongst themselves about it while they watch me overthink and ruminate after what they say. They call it “high talk” bc everything they say during this “high talk” involves someone getting brain cancer or being stupid/ill and they always look at me when they say this shit and laugh together when i overthink it. I always think its bc of something ive done which made them say this stuff.  I can somewhat understand bc of what i mentioned earlier about our drug trips and me sometimes not being to help them through anxiety attacks bc i was having my own anxiety attack. Makes me feel very alone and isolated, even by family bc they know of my drug use and i feel have somehwat disowned me bc of it.',\n",

Without my knowledge or consent, the mods deleted the posts almost a year after I first posted them and several months after I reposted them. Their reasoning was inane- even though the posts had been up a year and had more than 2000 upvotes and countless comments on how helpful the links were, the mods apparently decided they couldn\\'t condone a \"random\\' list of links they personally didn\\'t vet. Since that time, I\\'ve been receiving non-stop private messages looking for the posts and if I can send the links. But the mods here at /r/depressed have been grateful enough to allow me to repost these lists and hopefully they will find their way to those who need them even though this is a small subreddit. \\n\\nA quick overview on myself, I am a 34 year old and was diagnosed with depression at a very early age. I have been on medication non-stop for 22 years and will continue to be on it the rest of my life most likely. Even though I am on medication, and without it I would lose my mind, I have been on more medications and combinations of medications than I can count and am considered treatment resistant because I\\'ve never fully responded to any treatment. I am considered to have what is called double depression, which means I go from dysthymia to varying degrees in severity of major depression- which means I don\\'t get breaks between episodes. I have numerous other symptoms that developed from long term depression, which means each and every day is a battle against both my mind *and* my body. I’m not sure there’s much I haven’t tried- years of talk therapy, sports and exercise, yoga, hypnotherapy, acupuncture, massage, diet change, travelling around the world, jumping out of planes… the list goes on. I have checked into programs at psychiatric hospitals, have been through rounds of ECT without change, and was part of a specialized TMS study that fully maps my brain in order to pinpoint a consistent spot within a few millimeters. During this study, I had consistent PET and MEG scans to note the effects (or lack of) during the trial to give the doctors an objective documentation, rather than just my subjective reporting of how I feel, of the effects on my brain. In trial reports, I am referred to as the non-responder. Depression is visible on my brain scans as easily as a broken arm is on an x-ray. \\n\\nBut all that I have said about depression and how I’ve attempted to treat it is applicable only to me. What has or hasn’t worked for me, what caused side effects and what caused no effects, are in no way indicative of how they will affect anyone else. And the depression itself presents in many forms, even within one person. \\nI do believe for some people it is a disease while for others it is a condition. Also I think the spectrum of severity is so vast that it does both the sufferers and the societal stigma a great disservice to have a single word that someone uses when they are having a bad hair day to the diagnosis given to someone in a vegetative, non-functioning state looking for death to come. I liken it to the lung condition spectrum. On one end you have the sniffles, then the cold, the flu, bronchitis, pneumonia, emphysema, and end stage lung cancer on the far end. Only you can only use the word \"the flu\" to describe every one of these conditions. So you have both sufferers and non-sufferers alike telling people at the end stage lung cancer part of the spectrum that if they just pop a few echinacea and get some rest, they\\'ll be feeling fine in a day or two. No one flippantly says, \"I\\'m feeling a little diabetic today,\" or \"I think I\\'m going into an episode of leukemia from all the stress lately in my life\" - this is why even those that have suffered from depression help perpetrate the stigma because they judge others based on what treatment helped them in their specific state or however they specifically felt or how long it took them to get over it. If I hear I\\'ll be helped by yoga and meditation one more time...\\n\\nFor most people, depression is treatable, but there is no instant fix or single miracle cure. Be your own advocate in your treatment and follow any path that you think may help bring you relief. I realize it\\'s hard to fight to reclaim your life against a disease controlling your mind and saying you\\'d be better off dead, but this is why those who battle depression are the strongest people you\\'ll ever meet. We don\\'t have people bringing us casseroles, sending us get well cards, co-workers offering to fill in extra hours, people posting facebook messages about how they are praying for us, no one calling to check in on us, or often don\\'t even have the luxury of publicly naming our disease without fear of backlash and shaming and judgment.  But we do it- we continue to live each day running on empty, bound and chained down by what Professor Robert Sapolsky calls, \"the worst disease you can get\" and what renowned psychiatrist Peter Kramer believes is the \"most devastating disease known to mankind.\" And those who don\\'t make it through another day, they didn\\'t give up- they simply lost the battle to a powerful enemy. \\n\\nDepression fucking sucks. Fear of death is not nearly as scary as fear of living another day. But how do we see most diagnosed with serious illnesses? Rotten luck. There is no shame in suffering the illness of depression. It’s just rotten fucking luck. \\n\\nI will be periodically updating and adding more links as I come across additional helpful information.

In this month\\'s edition, they have a section on depression. To quote them, \"depression is a medical problem, like having diabetes or needing eyeglasses. It is nothing to be ashamed of...\" Yet their policy won\\'t cover any hospitalization or in-patient treatment facility for mental health issues. Also, there is a set limit on psychiatry visits and no coverage for therapy visits (even though this flyer points out how crucial therapy is for recovery). So no, they do not treat mental health like diabetes, and certainly don\\'t treat it like a medical issue requiring medical treatment. The kicker is the section is with a picture of smiling doctor in a lab coat with a stethoscope saying he\\'s here to help- yet he is a medical doctor in a hospital or medical facility, not a psychiatrist (just a guess given the lab coat and stethoscope)- the exact people this insurance policy gives absolutely no coverage to see.\\n***\\nsuicide:\\n[Night Falls Fast](http://www.amazon.com/Night-Falls-Fast-Understanding-Suicide/dp/0375701478)\\n\\nfrom the r/suicidewatch mods: \\n\\n[proven strategies for helping someone at risk:](http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/igh87/concerned_but_dont_know_what_to_say_here_are_some/)\\n\\n[Worried about someone who may be suicidal?

Also unlike the almost instant effects of speed, the mood-improving effects of antidepressants develop slowly over a number of weeks. “Speed” induces a highly artificial state, antidepressants cause the brain to slowly increase its production of naturally occurring neurotransmitters.\\n***\\n[PART 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/3d6gaa/my_massive_list_of_depression_resources_part_2/)',\n",

She’s not wrong of course. But what I don’t know how to explain to her is how I truly feel about it all. When people are dying of terminal diseases, there’s an option to pull to the plug, to stop their suffering instead of gambling on the one in a million chance they’ll pull through. Why can’t people think about depression and suicide the same way? If the emotional pain is so visceral that people kill them selves to stop it, shouldn’t it be a valid school of thought? Therapy and medication are the life support and depression is the terminal cancer. Some people spend years switching meds and seeing professionals, and struggling everyday. If we give terminally ill patients an out when things aren’t working, why can’t depressed people have the same? How long are people expected to suffer? How long must a person torment themselves all because their family or society says they shouldn’t give up? I should be able to pull the plug if my suffering is too much to bare.

I was genuinely happy with her and just be with and around her, no sexual stuff required. \\n\\nA few months after we started, it got around that we were friends and hanging out. A conniving bitch, lets call her Lucia, who was madly obsessed over me for some reason, decided to start harassing Melina. She would come up to her in between classes and just plain insult her, she would call her “whore” on Facebook, it was some really toxic stuff. After a little time of that, Melina told me she was getting depressed and feeling all kinds of sad stuff because of it and that people weren’t talking to her anymore. \\n\\nI made the executive decision to make a deal with Lucia that I would stop talking to Melina if she would cut the shit, to which she happily agreed. So that was that. I stopped talking and hanging out with her and she wasn’t harassed anymore, the posts were taken down, etc. But the one thing that was making me happy was now gone because I’m a stupid, honor-bound idiot who thinks that promises are more important than being happy. \\n\\nThis was 3 years ago. I’m almost finished with college. She is now married and we haven’t talked since. I still think about her.\\n\\nFuck me',\n",

Over a few months him and I had become friends, he would invite me over to his house every weekend and we would hang out, go fishing, or just chill... a few months in, he decided to join the military,  was leaving for basic and had a big party at his house.

I don\\'t know but the older one turned into a total whore, she took half her clothes off and started feeling me, and several others up that night... Well her girlfriend did not like that at ALL. \\\\[No sex happened\\\\]  and 3 days later... (yes three days later) after the party she went to the police after her girlfriend told her mother that she had been RAPED... well the police followed up on it, and tracked me to college, ARRESTED ME IN CLASS... found out that it was NOT rape, but sexual assault... and convicted me thereof... WHEN all i did is touch her ass... \\\\[YES I SHOULDN\\'T HAVE DONE THAT... I was fucked up... and had this half naked girl on top of me rubbing on my chest... i\\'m sorry but fuck can\\'t I get any slack?

YES THREATENED... at this point I just wish they would just kill me...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSkip forward a year... at this point I started counselling and they prescribed me Cymbalta.. \\\\[an anti-depressant\\\\] because I was constantly crying.. I didn\\'t want to do shit... I hated everything there is to hate... I never left home... mom cried I was depressed... So I tried to overdose... It failed miserably and I got admitted into the psych hospital against my will... it was awful... then that November the house i\\'m living in caught fire and burned to the ground and I lost EVERYTHING... all my notes... my childhood collections... everything that meant anything to me.... electrical fire.... I still resent that day, and it was a year ago. Well that brings me to where I am now... and my current complaint\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAll of the past... all of my resentment leads me to this moment... and the moment to where I feel like I can not continue... I want to die... I hate life, I hate everything there is to hate about everything... people disgust me... it\\'s only in moments of desperation that we find out what animals we truly are\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLast year, I started a relationshit (mhm) with what is now my fiancee. We were going strong at the beginning, and now it\\'s meh. All we do is argue, but i\\'ll get to that in a moment... 2 months ago we decided to have a child.. and now she is pregnant. mostly because of her LYING to me about being pregnant before then having a serious argument when I would use a condom since \"she\\'s already pregnant\" petty I know but i thought (Well, she just wants to have a baby, so she must be happy. I had already asked her to marry me and our wedding is planned so why the hell not?) One month after that February of this year.. (4 months ago) my mama and little brother (18) were killed in an accident.. two of the closest people in my life and gone... I WANT TO GO TOO!!! I cried... dealing with two different funerals in two weeks.... now I hate everyone... I didn\\'t want to be intimate for a while after the accident, with my fiancee... I cry constantly... I can\\'t talk to her because she has ABSOLUTELY NO empathy for anything I go through... but we will get there in a moment.. Where do I go???? Depression forums with people online WHO DON\\'T KNOW ME BRING ME MORE SUPPORT THAN HER?? Reddit?? I don\\'t know what I need... Everything is shit... my life  SUCKS... I want to die man... i just want to fucking die...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOn forward to our relationshit... Because of MY position it is hard for me to get a job... She has a job making 15 an hour.. bringing in about 1500 a month or so... My older brother lets me work for him on the weekends and I bring in about 800 a month... That\\'s it I pay the rent and the utilities and my check is gone... and she constantly tells me i\\'m lazy when she has WATCHED me fill out multiple applications for jobs... and knows my position... some jobs have even fired me after finding about my job because I have to tell them... regardless... she hates where we live... constantly blames me for every shit thing in HER life.. yet alone mine... yells at me... swears at me... literally degrades me and runs me into the ground.... tells me she\\'s unhappy and wants the leave, don\\'t even want a wedding at this point.... But I don\\'t want to leave her... she has no empathy... I do everything for her in my power for her, but she does not return because she\\'s an entitled brat and \"money is a stresser\" I grew up fucking poor, but I had food on the table and a place to live... I didn\\'t have NICE elegant lifestyle she had... she got everything she wanted when I had to make do... nothing is enough for her... She had a rough past I get that.. but damn that doesn\\'t mean she has the right to treat me like shit... every time we go out she fucking passive aggessive comments \"well we could buy that if my husband had a job, and wasn\\'t so lazy\" or... \"I hate having to buy everything I wish someone had a JOB\" I tell her to budget her money better \"I have no right\" motherfu- ...... and that\\'s just the tip of the iceburg... my dad called her on her shit and she got mad because \"I didn\\'t stand up for her\"\\n\\n\"Are you going to take the car son, or is that going to piss her off like everything else does\" My childhood friend was over at the house one day and felt awkward because all we did was fight.. he says something and now \"all my family hates her\" because of the way she treats me... TREAT ME BETTER... GO AROUND THEM AND STOP ACTING LIKE A STUCK UP PRICK... this leads me to my final point....\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m about to be done with her... but once again, because of my charge she will more than likely end up with full custody of our child.... so she and the baby will be gone... our baby.. THE ONLY THING IN THIS FUCKING WORLD THAT COULD MAKE ME FEEL BETTER... ....... all because I groped a teenager on the ass I\\'ve lost everything... I have nothing left... only my father who is deteriorating in health.. by the way my fiancee tells me \"I\\'m more concerned being a son than a husband\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR; Got a sexual assualt charge because I was fucked up at a party, had a house burn down, lost everything... lost my mother and little brother (18) in a car accident... now going to loose my fiancee and my child because i\\'m a fucking looser... want to die already',\n",

       " 'Hello, hope you are all doing well. This is actually my first post on Reddit. I\\'ve always come to reddit when ever I\\'ve needed some advice on a topic, and recently I\\'ve been using Reddit for help/advice on how I\\'m feeling (the title). I found so many of your answers to be helpful and some of them made me feel happier even if they weren\\'t directed at me. I don\\'t actually expect a response from this, I just felt like a place to write all of it down.\\n\\nI\\'ll try to keep this short (no promises). I haven\\'t actually been medically diagnosed with depression, but from just searching up the symptoms and doing online research it sure does seem like it. I\\'m usually (or at least was) a very happy, outgoing, positive person. People have said that I\\'m one of the nicest people that they\\'ve ever met. One friend literally told me that she had been having a bad day and the moment I walked into the room it was like I was radiating happy energy; which made her feel better. Making people laugh, smile, and happy in general always made me feel better. I\\'m still this person, but a lot of the time I feel as though this person is ceasing to exist. It\\'s getting harder and harder to stay happy, and to be outgoing; and I don\\'t know why. Sometimes I think \"It\\'s one of those things where the happiest person on the outside is the saddest on the inside.\"\\n\\nI\\'ve been getting more and more insecure about everything. I used to always overthink, but now I find myself overthinking about everything: \"Am I being weird?\" \"Do my friends actually like me?\". It\\'s even with people on the street: \"That person just looked at me, is there something wrong with me?\". Normally I would talk to my friends (who I love dearly), but again with the overthinking: \"They don\\'t want to hear any of this.\" \"They\\'ve got better things to do than to hear my problems.\" I do understand that they are here for me, but all that physically will stop me from talking to them.\\n\\nFamily is the same, I can\\'t really talk to them about this either. I\\'m worried that all of this will scare and worry them, which again stops me from telling them. When I was 13 ish, my dad had a huge fight with my step mum because of me (I won\\'t get into that because that would make this post way longer than it already is). They would fight a lot, and a lot of the fights were because of me. Anyways, after this fight in particular I went out onto our balcony and climbed over the railing and onto the edge (which was just wide enough for me to stand on). It was there, with my toes hanging off the edge, that I looked straight down 31 floors and thought of jumping. Well, I didn\\'t and I told my dad straight after and he told me to never tell him anything like that again because it scared the shit out of him. Hence my fear of telling my family about my thoughts, I suppose.\\n\\nWoah okay this post is already getting reaaaalllly long. There\\'s so much shit that I can continue going on about, but I\\'ll do a summary (never ever been good at those). Aside from the overthinking and the whole \"I used to be a happy person\" thing, feeling lonely is something that eats away at me everyday. I\\'ve been single for 2 years, and during those two years I have not had sex. A lot of my friends are in the cutest relationships with the best people, and as happy as I am for them, (I feel horrible saying this) but I\\'m also quite jealous (probably another reason why I can\\'t talk to my friends as I can\\'t tell them this). It\\'s been harder and harder to meet new people, especially with me feeling like I am not as outgoing and chirpy as before. And the longer it takes, the harder it gets.\\n\\nThis all then sort of combines into this feeling of worthlessness and how everything is pointless. I\\'m 20 and I have a full time 9-5 office job as a graphic designer. And every day I have a thought somewhere along the lines of \"Is this all worth it?\" \"Where am I going in life?\" \"What\\'s the whole fucking point?\". I think of suicide from time to time, but I will never do it because I don\\'t want to inflict any sadness and hurt on to my friends or family. However I\\'m worried that the longer it gets the more likely I am to do so.\\n\\nI don\\'t really know where I\\'m going with this post anymore. I started out with something to say but now it\\'s all become paragraphs of randomness. I guess it\\'s just how I\\'ve been feeling and possible reasons to why I\\'m feeling so? One of the things that I want to do is fix this, and not let it scare me anymore.',\n",
       " 'So... here I come to the depressed subreddit to tell my story. Well where do I start?\\n\\n Like in the title I am 34yrs old, 5\\'2\", 350lbs, I still live with my parents, I\\'ve never had a job, I don\\'t have my drivers license, I\\'ve never had a girlfriend nor have I been in a relationship with a girl my entire life, and I\\'m a virgin to add on top of all of that. The reason I still live with my parents is I suffer from high anxiety and depression which makes it really hard for me to socialize with people. That\\'s also another thing I forgot to add is I am very anti-social. I will admit I did have one job, but it only lasted a few days because it was a job at the mall at one of the kiosks and I ended up having a panic attack.\\n\\n Yes I do take medication for my depression but it only last for a little while. I\\'ve never had a relationship with a girl my entire life because I\\'m shy and of course anti-social. Also I was home schooled so I never interacted with actual students. I\\'ve been wanting to go out with a girl for a long time but I just can\\'t seem to find the right person to ask. I\\'ve tried online dating but that doesn\\'t seem to work. \\n\\nAlso I am a virgin so I\\'ve never had sex before and yes I\\'m one of those guys who is like always horny so I just deal with it like everyone else does which is masturbating. I know that\\'s a lovely thing to tell people on here but hey I\\'ve seen worse things told on Reddit lol. I\\'ve also moved a lot and I now live in Houston TX for 19yrs now. I\\'m mostly a homebody and lay in bed most of the day doing things on my computer. I\\'m more social online then in real life. \\n\\nI do get out of the house sometimes when one of my parents have to go out and run errands. I enjoy collecting things like Transformers, Hot Toys figures, and Funko POPs. I do get money from my father twice a month so I guess that\\'s where my income comes from. I know its not the best way to get money, but my father offers it to me so I take what I can get. \\n\\nHe gives it to me as I help do things around the house and I help my mother out as she suffers from fibromyalgia and can\\'t left heavy stuff. I try to save my money, but I just spend it on stuff I like to collect which I have too much of right now. I had to move to one of the other rooms in our house when we had our floors cleaned and my grandma is staying with us for six weeks until her place is ready to move into. So I had to pack my stuff and its all stacked up in my father\\'s office room.\\n\\n I\\'ve been meaning to start moving some of it back into my room but I just can\\'t seem to get myself to do it. I pretty much procrastinate a lot. I would like to make some friends on here and talk to people who are in the same position I\\'m in. I also get pretty lonely that sometimes I\\'ll talk to myself which oddly enough I do a lot when I\\'m out of the house. \\n\\nI forgot to mention why I haven\\'t gotten a drivers license well I guess I\\'m just afraid to do it and having to do the driving part with someone in the car with you makes my anxiety really high. So that pretty much covers most of my depressing life story. I guess I\\'m posting this on here so I can just get some input on what I should do to make changes in my life.',\n",

Not an native english speaker.\\n\\nWe met at a time where I was really depressed. A time I was really not hoping I would ever meet a person that could change my life. Oh I was so wrong...\\n\\nI am going to refer to her as just ***M***\\n\\nWe were 17, 3th year in our high-school. Interestingly enough, the first time we ever saw each other was on my birth day. She of course didn\\'t know at the time that it was my birth day. The first time I saw her I made her smile. I didn\\'t try, nor did I say something. I tend to make people laugh or smile when they are around me, but I don\\'t consider my self as a funny guy. We have a same friend so she would come often to our part of the school where our class room was so she can talk to him. Me and my friend were in the same class, she wasn\\'t. The first time we officially met was at our friend birth day, some days after mine. We were both happy we finally met each other. We days gone by and our school organised an excursion (had to google the word..) to Prague and Vienna for a couple of days. My friends, she and I were going. I was really exited. I remember those couple of days as being the best days of my life, up until the last day (will explain why). Those are...or were...my favorite cities in europe and going there with the people I truly cherish was mind blowing for me. Even now as I wright this I can\\'t but find a huge Joker smile on my face. We walked, talked, made each other laugh, and we were getting to know each other in those beautiful Prague streets. We even hanged at my room in the hotel which I shared with some friend (a school organised thing, need I remind you) over night. My fondest memory was walking over Karl\\'s bridge, not even looking around or being aware I was walking over that amazing bridge because I was walking with her, talking about her. We were both so deeply involved in our conversations that we didn\\'t really cared that much where we were, or were are we going.\\n\\nI can\\'t speak on her behalf but I can tell time stopped for the both of us.\\n\\nThe last day which was in Vienna was really difficult for me because one of my childhood friends committed suicide back home, and all i got was a text and a hand written letter waiting for me back home. I was paralyzed but even at that difficult time I was semi-okay because ***M*** was right there. She noticed that I wasn\\'t okey, one of meny times she will notice that I was not okey... We talked in the bus as we were going home. I wish i could go back in time just so I can see us walking over that bridge...\\n\\nDays and moths passed and our friendship only grew bigger, but so was my depression. Depressed not because of my childhood friend ( well yes but that\\'s not the true cause of my inner pain), but another female friend who basically gave a introverted boy a new life. Life separated us, we never saw each other, we changed but I was after all those years still in love with that girl, hoping life will bring her back...and than came ***M***...\\n\\n***M*** was starting to be like a drug for me, I couldn\\'t eat, sleep, think properly. I wanted to go to school just so we can talk and laugh together. And so, slowly but surely I was falling in love with here even tho i didn\\'t want that, because I knew I would be having love problems, or any problems for that matter because I know I\\'m unfit to be in a relationship in that state. I had too much respect for her, and even if she wanted a relationship with me I would make here change her mind. This was the problem that only grew over the years which will later in life try to kill me...\\n\\nI prayed to God for not making me fall in love with her just so I could avoid...this. As you can see, he didn\\'t answer.\\n\\nIn our 4th and our last year in our high-school ***M***( which became my bestfriend), my \"friends\" and me wanted to go to the same college. Oh and why \"\" on \\'\\'friend\" you might ask? One of my best friends notices I was getting mentally worse and worse because of school stress, love, and collage application test. He noticed but was not willing to help me, so he literally turned other people backs on me by saying I was a freak, an idiot, a psyco..etc. Basically I went from around 20 friends to 3. ***M*** and our same friend from the beginning of this entry were two of my three friends who didn\\'t want to listen nor believe in those lies. I was so broken, so damaged...self hatred grew by the day to the point I was planing my own suicide by hanging. I was so serious I was reading some forums on how to do it effectively  and the dangers of surviving a hanging. At the time I was really scared of my self. Lost a lot of friends, I was doing terrible in school to the point I knew I was going to fail, and if I fail I will not get the right documents with which I can apply for the college application test. If I don\\'t pass the grade, I don\\'t get the papers, if I don\\'t get the papers I cant apply, if I don\\'y apply ***M*** will apply and will get accepted with out me and ultimately...I won\\'t be seeing her...\\n\\nI was 100% sure I was going to fail and was thinking about suicide a lot. The only time I was not thinking about that was when I looked at her. We didn\\'t even need to talk, I could just look at the across the hall and everything would be ok. If it wasn\\'t for her at that time I would not be writing this and you would be reading or doing something else. The thing that bothered me was I was, and still am deeply in love with here but knowing that I am not capable for a relationship or even knowing I wasn\\'t the right for her is still killing me inside, and I can\\'t stop it...it hadn\\'t stop for years... \\n\\nIt\\'s like she knew I was wanting to kill my self so she would randomly walk towards me and we would just talk like nothing bad was ever happening in my rotting mind. She knew but didn\\'t knew the scale of my pain. It\\'s like God made her walk towards me just so I can live for another week or so. Maybe it was just a coincidence...make of it as you wish. At the time I knew these were our last days together so I cherished every second of our conversations. I was aware of the quote \"cherish before it\\'s too late\\'\\' so I did just that, and even tho it was two years ago I can still vividly remember those sweet and cute moments. I knew these were our last days together so I wanted to tell her that I deeply love her. (Starting to cry again...) I knew I couldn\\'t look her in those blue-marbel eyes and tell her that, I was too scared of the reaction. She was not my bestfriend but something more...but I knew I couldn\\'t have more, only less. I was counting our last days, and every day was worse and worse. \\n\\nShe got accepted, and I faild...\\n\\nThe summer break began and we saw each other one time of the three or four months of free time... But even tho we went out I will cherish that day till my last day. I tried, not only thru the summer but even when we went to school, I tried going out with her to the movies, coffee, shakes...etc nothing except that one beautiful day.  I cant say if she didn\\'t want to go with me or she really couldn\\'t. Needless to say she is a super hot and bright girl, and I\\'m an over weight peace of shit that likes to help every single soul on this planet even tho some don\\'t deserve it cause I love helping people but most of all I looove making people smile, and thank God that\\'s a natural thing for me because I just turn off my brain when I\\'m talking to people, only motor skill needed to make people laugh it seems... She was at the time the only person in my life that didn\\'t see me as I saw my self, and that blew me away. Some can say that\\'s the real reason I love her...Does anybody need a reason to love a person? \\n\\nThe last time we saw each other was at the first day of collage, 1st of October last year. On that day I gave her a birth day gift even tho her birth day was tomorrow. I know I won\\'t be seeing her after that day so I gave her on that day. It was really emotional for me, because It was not just a birth day gift, which was a signed marvel Star Boy comic-book and it was signed ofc by The Weeknd (bragging a little) but my \\'\\'thank you, good bye and I love you\\'\\'. I told her to open it tomorrow when she gets back home after collage. I told her to open it tomorrow so I could unfollow her on instagram, remove her from facebook, and even...delete our texts. I was basically ripping her out of my world like a fresh bandage on a fresh open wound. Why? I was so in love that I wanted to protect her from the most  destructive person that she knows...Me. She found a way to thank me with a message but that was it.\\n\\nThat was the last time we would ever speak to each other...it\\'s been little over a year and we still don\\'t talk...\\n\\nI managed to finish school, went on some preparations for the same college...again (went the first time when I was in the 4th year of HS), met a lot of new people there and managed to stay in touch with my two friends from HS.\\n\\nOver the year I did something I really wished I didn\\'t done but I just couldn\\'t keep it together...I stalked her on instagram with a random account. I feel so mad at my self and sometimes I\\'m even sick because I know I shouldn\\'t be doing that but I miss her so fucking much that some times I can\\'t even sleep because I spent my nights thinking about her, remembering our funny little moments, and even writing (I have a journal for my mental problems and it really helped me) about these thing that keep me locked, sick and depressed. I didn\\'t check her profile every single day (not that mad), just periodically just because I really miss her smile sometimes, or I\\'m just wondering is she ok, is everything okay in her life, how is she? If stalking for that reason is a crime than lock me up. I get worried and paranoid (especially when I come back home after drinking) but at the end, I know that i don\\'t need to worry...she is always, 24/7 surrounded by the people who love her and that she loves. I would be just a number in that pool of people that adore her. I would not make a difference.\\n\\nIt hurts like hell because she took that good bye like it\\'s just a normal, every day \\'\\'bye\\'\\' but it\\'s not. I can\\'t look at her in a \\'\\'best friend\\'\\' manner, she is just so much more. But I get the felling that I don\\'t matter to her...at all. She texted me that she got in, a sign that she really wanted to me to know that she got accepted at our dream college, if I didn\\'t matter she wouldn\\'t text me. It\\'s like she took that way to easily than me, like she wanted me to leave her the fuck alone... maybe I\\'m just paranoid and mad at my self and not willing seeing the truth, that she did hurt, but I just didn\\'t see it...\\n\\nWe texted but nothing much. Just some few stupid texts. I wrote to her because the silence was too much for me on Viber even tho I knew she didn\\'t open it in a while. Our main way of communication is via watsapp, because I don\\'t have the balls to delete her phone number. I deleted it so meany times I know it by heart. \\n\\nA year passed and I too got accepted. My ***M*** is now ...m...\\n\\nWe both changed. I tried finding my self, and tried loving my self just a bit more. Learned drawing, and learned a lot about history, art and other stuff over the year. Grown my hair even. She too changed, not my looks, but...i don\\'t know... I am not the person she remembers and she Is not the girl that saved my life. We see each other with the corner of our eyes, but we don\\'t talk, we just pass by each other and it\\'s fucking k-i-l-l-i-n-g me. But the most worst thing, and the thing that drove me overboard is that I saw her smoking. She isn\\'t the type of a person that you would assume that smokes. She was a dancer, the type of person that didn\\'t drink beer, didn\\'t smoke, didn\\'t do stupid shit, not even drinking coca-cola. When I saw her... it was like Thanos came and snapped me from existence. I wanted to jump off the building. I am so fucking sick, and so incredible mad at my self right now... I know I couldn\\'t to anything to help, but just the taught of me getting accepted with her and studying together could  have made a difference makes my soul wanna ripp my mind apart. I don\\'t have a problem for smoking or other stuff, i tried it all ( the legal, and easy obtainable illegal stuff) and I would not normally judge, but this threw me off the ledge. I\\'m furious at my self for not helping her like she helped me, even tho I know I shouldn\\'t be. I helped so...sooo much people because she helped me and she didn\\'t even know at the time that our little silly talks kept me alive.\\n\\nOnly one moth passed and I all ready don\\'t feel so good... I don\\'t know if God is playing a joke on me or life just likes fucking me around but this...this is too much.\\n\\nI really miss her but I know, and see that my ***M*** doesn\\'t exit anymore. A year can change a person... for better or for worse.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nZnam da najverovatnije nećeš nikad ovo videti ali nije više ni bitno. Mnogo mi nedostaješ...

       " 'In the last 4 months I’ve lost 5kgs, going from 55 to 50 kg. At my height, that’s underweight. I’ve only been losing hair but I’ve pinned that to the stress I was under during finals in June. It hasn’t gotten better so I was wondering if it was something physically wrong with me and been thinking of going to the doctor to the my blood tested or something. \\n\\nBut I’ve been feeling down a lot lately. Kinda emotionally unstable. It takes very little to send me down a spiral where I feel like life isn’t worth it anymore.

He made me feel good about myself all the time. He called me Beautiful, he called me gorgeous and he always said he loved me. Everyday. Just life is impossible now....i just wanna say something to him. Everyone finds him ugly but idk how. I find him really handsome and he always said “everyone else at school is ugly, your the only pretty one.” He also said “I’m never gonna stop loving you. your the only person who i love to be around. If we ever break up i’m gonna kill myself.” When we got 2gether i said “aren’t we to young? I don’t wanna destroy our friendship.” he said “So what if we’re to young? And whose gonna be the one to break up? i don’t think our friendship is gonna end.” I guess he lied. I have no clue what to do now. Idk what to say to him. All i wish for in life is for him to like me again and for us to get married and have the most amazing life. That’s what we said we would have.. i just want it to come back. He was my first everything.  we agreed to be friends again but we’re far away from what we were. i don’t wanna loose him by saying the wrong thing. What do you think i should say to him? i’ve tried a lot of things but nothing is working...',\n",

       " \"There are 2 different kinds of support a depressed person needs. These can come from one or two different people. Those people can't be depressed themselves otherwise it defeats the purpose of them being there. It can be a person who has gone through depression and is now over it.\\n\\nThe first type of support is the logical support. This support helps you find things to do that are logical and helps you do things that you do in your daily life nicely. This person acts as the bigger brain for your brain. The peraon can make your brain understand ehat can be done in a logical manner. However, just like a human body, we can either decide to accept the instructions by the bigger brain or reject them if they dont make sense.\\n\\nThe second type of support is emotional support. This support gives you warmth for your heart. For it to be rebuilt from the things it has gone through. This person can help you rebuild any trust issues you may have or any kind of emotional stress you may be going through. This support acts like a heart for your body. A heart that cares for you and your body. A heart that knows what you are thinking and what you feel about any topic that may be brought up. Its almoat like a new heart has been placed into your body and it doesn't know a thing about you as a person so you have to teach it.\\n\\nA depressed persons heart and mind are in a constant conflict. They are in a fight that no one can win. Your conscience can try to stop them but its only a matter of time they start again; and hence your body needs a new pair or heart and mind that is able to think outside the box or outside your field of view. Again, these people can  be 2 different people or just one person.\\n\\nIf you have any people you can share your deepest thoughts with and trust them completely, then maybe approach them as either one of the people. Remember that you cant decide which type of support they will offer or which body part of the two (heart or mind) they will be. It depends on their personality alone. They decide.\\n\\nIf you dont have any people or friends you can share your story with, see if you can find new people. There are a few sub reddits that are there to find new friends who can relate as they have been through thesame things as you, or can just offer you those supports. If social media is not your strong point maybe go out into the world and see if you can find someone who maybe able to help. If you are an introverted person, give social media a try.\\n\\n\\n** I am by no means a doctor, therapist or a councellor. This post is simply a personal observation that i had taken in the course of a few months. This is not in any shape or form a replacement from therapy or councelling. If needed seek councelling and therapy as they can offer professional advice. **\",\n",

I also have this feeling that says \"you do not belong here\" somekind of nostalgia for the past, and ironically everyother people i meet sooner or later says something like \"you sound/behave/look like you should have been born in the middle ages\" That\\'s not what brought me here. I know i\\'m capable of standing that (i have been standing it for the last 10 years of my life). \\nA few months ago i finally found a girl that on sight made me forgot about everything, like a huge burden just got lifted. and everything worked so fine so perfectly... at least in 90% of everything, the other 10% i was sure we can fix it with time and patience... she made me laugh hard, made feel happy and really alive, best part was according to her it was the same i was the first men she actually wanted to marry, to have sons to share a life with... and i lose her, due to several stuff (that started with me being kind of and a-hole sending some messages onf fb) and get worse whit she treating me like a piece of garbage during her thesis defense. we broke up... better said she broke up with me.\\n\\nIt hurts me harder than anything in my life (and i belive me when i say i have gotten into some really nasty falls and accidents ) i feel like i couldnt breath. In a desperate and stupid attemp to win her back: I cried, i ask a friend to please arrange a meeting, go to her home (only to return without talking to her because when i called her and she picked up i din\\'t had the courage to tell her i was nearly at her front door) I broke all my rules for her, i even call her mother to see if she can intercede for me. in the end... on a day i wen\\'t to gift her some cookies (she loves cookies) i meet her on the way to her home, we chat just a bit... she seemed happy, but it kills me see her and the eyes and not see that bright like before. i could well have been just another guy saying hi... months passed and sometimes we talk a bit, just a few text messages, to deal with it i have done a lot of excercise and meditation, i went to a psychologist... date other girls, etc. and everything \"went better\"  the pain fade away bit by bit, i still thought of her every now and then of course, but it was \"better\". \\n\\nThe last few days without a real reason she started to pop up on my mind again, maybe because we haven\\'t talk in the last month i don\\'t know finally i thought i\\'d do something, maybe invite her to go out. Yesterday i did it, ask by text how she has been and say my birthday was in three days (wich is true) and that i want to take an ice cream with her. nothing more nothing less. she told she coulnd\\'t she was busy, i still ask what day she wasn\\'t busy \"all of tehm i\\'m busy\" was the answer... it was like everything started again, i even got fever... and now i\\'m here feeling worst than before, i would have been happy (or at least have a normal life) facing my old demons, but facing them and losing her it\\'s killing me... don\\'t know what more to ad... thanks for reading me.',\n",

I have no idea why i get blown off or ignored. I mean, I could guess, but that\\'s just my fucked up head saying things and itll make things worse. I am just exhausted from being there for everyone and then being alone when the worst parts of my mind take over. And I dont want sympathy for them I just would like to fucking have company so I dont do anything bad to myself that I know and they know is a real possibility and is probably going to happen if I\\'m left alone which I always am. \\n\\nI know no one wants to be around me because I\\'m depressed. I\\'m no fun and I\\'m just boring and sad all the time, but I just need help and I\\'ve tried so hard to get better at reaching out, but it\\'s all for not.

The vast majority of my nuclear and extended family have alienated any sort of capability he has for anything and he can\\'t stand it. They don\\'t see him as a human being anymore, rather a constant *risk* of some kind. I am deathly afraid of this happening to me. And 2: I don\\'t really relate to my \"friends\". They\\'re just people who don\\'t fit anywhere else, like me. So we kinda just group together like societal leftovers or something, but now new groups are forming. Groups that I *also* can\\'t relate to. So my interests are almost always shot down immediately. I opened up to these people about my struggle slightly out of desperation and they beraded me with insults and accusations of (paraphrase)\"farming for pity\" and taking advantage of them like some sort of master manipulator.

While they did this they kept telling me I needed help and that I *had* to listen to what they were saying or I\\'d \"end up dead\".\\n\\nThat\\'s the set-up.\\n\\nRecently they started a new group chat for one of the other guys in the group who was struggling with getting over a girl he perceived to be leading him on. Everyone flocked to him and congratulated him for being strong, but when I brought up that I was still struggling and said that I was horrified of being alienated by my family, they called me lazy, saying I \"wasn\\'t taking initiative\" to talk to someone. That made me feel extremely shitty and ashamed of why I\\'m feeling so depressed all the time; like what I\\'m going through means nothing and that I\\'m just lazy or useless.\\n\\nOn top of this, I think I\\'m slowly figuring out why I\\'ve been so depressed for so long, which happens to do with my sexuality. Funnily enough a surprising fraction of my \"friend\" group is homophobic. So that doesn\\'t help.\\n\\nMy fears of speaking about my suffering became a self-fulfilling prophecy and I wonder.

I've been through alot for only being 19 and my years before age 14 had alot of bad shit connected to it that im not 100% teady to talk about.  At 14 I finally cut contact with my drug addict father after he tried to get my siblings and I taken by the state (again) and get my step dad thrown in jail for false accusations of rape on my little sister. That alone was just a bad time. He called me the night i filed a restraining order to tell me he was going to kill himself and it was my fault, that he hoped i was happy that I caused it. Fast forward 3 months and I was told by my doctor that I have something genetically wring with the muscles and joints in my knees and they needed to do surgery. Fine whatever its just to check on things and I was fine after a week of rest. All they did was clean up scar tissue. However i had just started highschool and was in a junior ROTC program through the army. I was excited and wanted to make a difference that my POS father refused to. I loved this program it was my family and I made really good friends. I joined their shooting team and made it my goal. I got good, really good, too 10 in the nation good . My coach and instructors were ther closest thing to a father I had. I loved them and I felt safe with them. A year goes by and my surgeon tells me he was wrong. He had missed something and thats why I was in pain, he ended up doing an extensive surgery on me at 16, cutting bone and screwing it in at another spot, cutting muscle and ligaments to release pressure and cutting into one of my hamstrings so I wouldn't loose the ability to walk. Recovery for that was terrible. I couldn't walk, couldn't shoot, couldn't do much of anything. I gained probably 40 pounds over my 3 month recovery. I had finally recovered from it and was back in swing and ready for my first big event with my friends. It was an annual ball that the rotc puts on and I was finnally back with my family, couldn't do much but back. I remeber that night because it was one of the last times I felt complete. I was invites to another party a week after but I had to turn it down, my leg wasn't ready and I just couldn't.  I went to sleep early and woke up with over 100 notifications. Come to find out my best friend who had invited me the night before had gotten in an accidnet and died on the way home.I was shaken to my core. His back up driver was shit faced and killed him and it was all becuase I wasn't there. A month later I was at his funeral and we were able to give him a send off to be proud of, all I remember was crying. I had lost one of my two bestfriends, the people who stood by me and had to torn apart relationships in the process of grieving. That excat night another tragedy struck, the third in our trio, a friend of mine sense elementary had passed away from complications with the flu. I was absolutely devastated. I couldn't function. Both of my pillars just died within a month of eachother. I threw myself into shooting and my coach. He was all the support I had left. Fast forward 6 months to the summer. My surgeon had just told me the day before that my other leg needed the same procedure and I could no longer be eligible for military service, the next day I rolled my car down a 30 foot embankment trying to swerve around two dogs. Once I was out of the hospital my coach called me to check on me and told me we would get breakfast after his hiking trip. My coach was epileptic but always loved to go on adventures, he was the classic Jersey stereotype with a heart of gold. I loved that man with everything I had. He was all I felt I had left. He ended up having an episode while hiking and fell of the side of a cliff,  they found his body the next morning on a rock on the river. I was completely devistated, I didnt know what to do but luckily I had made one more friend that I could talk too. I got my second surgery and gained more weight from the depression and lack of movement. This guy became my best friend, helped me through alot and let me vent to him. Flashforward to last month. He is on trial for child sex abuse and has confessdd to it but is now fighting it. I know he is guilty and being a victim of sexual abuse as a child I hate him for it. One of my last friends raped and abused his fathers girlfriend's daughter for years. Here I am now in college across the state and I am beyond lost with no true direction to follow. I want to go home and live closer to my family, but I am engaged and she is from the same town I lived in.

You’ll think that everything goes back to normal, but here’s where you’re wrong. It’ll never be the same. Yes, you’ll be better, but the despair of falling into the same state again never really leaves you. You’ll tread carefully with your next move, learning how to identify symptoms, how to help yourself get out of it. But there’s only so much you can do. Because you’re addicted to those feelings of extreme sadness, it’s the only thing you feel, it helps you feel again. You’re voided of all other happiness, excitement, love. Sadness, extreme bouts of sadness, that’s the only feeling. Holding your breath, holding in your stomach, you hold yourself and tell yourself it will be over, but it keeps happening again. And again. Till that you learn to live with it. Till that it is normal. You’re afraid of someone seeing you like this, because when you’re in it, you can’t control how you feel, how your face is drained of all life, how you’ve lost all your appetite, how anxiety takes over till you can’t sleep, can’t focus, it takes over all your priorities, it takes away all that you love, it leaves you empty and anxious. It eats away at you, slowly, but surely. You can’t pull yourself out of it. You try to snap out of it, your friends try, they try, but it does not work like that. Then after depression is done playing with you, you start feeling better, still voided of other emotions, but no longer anxious or sad. It changes you, it changed you. You’ll think that this is it.

If I'm in a bad mood right now then I won't give a fuck to anything. Even if I'm in my bad days I don't care if I'm disrespecting my family or if I'm being rude. I'm depressed but I care about my personal emotions. If I can't take care of my mental health then I should still atleast spoil myself by having the right to have reactions and feelings in situations. So if I roll my eyes on my uncle for controlling our family matters let me be. I hate it when people change plans and are fucking annoying. \",\n",

I received zero texts or online wishes.\\nI mean... Whatever, it's not that big a deal I guess.\\nBut... It does make me sad.\\n\\nAll I wanted to do was post and tell anybody who's reading, give a shout out to a friend.

I guarantee there’s more than you think. Me especially. After that, write out your dreams.

Your laugh, your smile, your personality, your hair, your skin, your compassion for others, anything. Giving up isn’t worth it. Look toward your future because there are so many bright things waiting there.\\nI have seen this pop up time and time again, via facebook, imgur, etc. I cannot share it enough and I can say with honesty that this has saved my life once before.

       " 'I hate it here I can’t stand my family friends school virus etc. Everyone is always so mean to me I’ve always been bullied and picked on for no reason when I’ve done nothing. I’ve been called fat ugly stupid had my acne pointed out etc. I am so insecure that I never leave the house and when friends try to call me out I always make up an excuse to stay in. I can’t even talk to my friends about my problems, they will never understand me. They have it easy. I can’t find love because I’ve been fucked over very brutally and ever since been scared. Life sucks I hate myself I’m embarrassed to be in my own body. Why was I such a target for bullying. Am I not that worthy of feeling good that someone needed to make fake accounts and make my life a living hell? Why did people make rumours about me why did people call me names I don’t understand. I just want to know why. Why am I so fat ugly stupid. I am so horribly insecure. Why do I suffer from anxiety. Why can’t life get any better for me it’s been this way for so long. When I was once happy it came dragging down. I have so much anger and hatred inside of me I just can’t anymore sometimes I scare myself. My parents piss me off so much. My mum read my diary without permission and told my dad shit in it and my dad told ppl shit about me and hits me why can’t I have privacy in thus house why does my brother have to be disabled. Why do I love food so much that I eat it to the point I feel sick? Why doesn’t anyone hire me? Honestly why am I still alive.',\n",
       " 'It’s been 3 years. In and out of each other’s lives over and over again. The first year we were together. It was long distance but we were together. I always traveled to you every time. To me you were worth anything no matter the distance. You were my world. You brought out a light in me that I didn’t know existed. You were my first true love. Ever since you broke up with me my world hasn’t been the same. On and off for 2 years we’ve contacted each other for who knows why. No one has brought the light into my life like you did. \\n\\nIf you asked me to come see you. I would drop everything to come see you. I’ve done that 3 times since we broke up. Each time was a bad experience but I loved you so I would do anything for you. Last time was before 2020. You told me you wanted to leave me behind in 2019. Here we are again you asking me to come see you. 6 hours away and $300 for 4 days. Right now I’m really struggling. I’ll be 21 years old this year. In my past 21 years of life I feel like I’ve done nothing right. I feel like I will never be anything. Same house, Same room for 21 years. Cheated throughout high school, didn’t go to college, never kept a job for more than 6 months. Stay jobless for months on end. I honestly have no desire to be anything. \\n\\nI have no plans. I have no future. I have nothing.',\n",

       " \"I am a US citizen. Over 40. $150,000 in student loan debt. Just recently went through bankruptcy. Divorced. Recently became a convicted violent felon....\\n\\nMy life was on track and I had no problem paying off the student loan. I made a lot of money doing something I loved. Then I was screwed over by my ex-wife. I cheated on her and she ruined my life. If you have read the book or watched the movie Gone Girl, similar thing happened to me. I was wrong to cheat on her which fueled her hatred of me, but I am not sure I deserved to lose everything. Still, it was my fault.\\n\\nIt has been over two years and after 6 months in jail, I finalized my bankruptcy and I have about $10,000 left to restart my life. I can't get the jobs that I once had. I used to work in a mid-sized corporation making $80,000 a year and on my way to that six figures. My degree was unrelated to my previous line of work and it was in social work, so I can't use that for specialized jobs. My resume is filled with years of steady work and volunteering at charities for many many years, but that information is useless with my new label as an ex-convict.\\n\\nI have worked as a server for a few months now to get by. Due to my good behavior, my 7-year probation will end in 3. I have never had a temper or violent tendencies or other criminal records. I was just pushed to the limit and my reaction was recorded on tape and used against me. In the past 40 years of my life, I had never gotten angry, but this one instance practically ruined my life. I was driven to a breaking limit and it was very obviously orchestrated, but I broke the law. At least I didn't have to go to prison for 5 years. I was given 9 months in jail, released in 6 for being good. I really enjoyed teaching other inmates GED materials and other life skills. Read a lot.\\n\\nI am moving to one of the EU countries. I have a friend from college/work that can get me a visa in his country through his company for at least 10 years. He has seen me work and I am very professional when it comes to work ethics. It doesn't pay very well, but I should make about $30K a year to start. But without the $1500/month student loan payment, I don't see an issue.\\n\\nI have a year left on my supervised probation. State of Iowa is tough on criminals, but the judge and the probation officer has been good to me as I have been a model inmate and probationer.\\n\\nI am finalizing my bankruptcy. I owe over $60,000 in CC debt. Legal bills mostly.\\n\\nI have 2 undergraduate degrees (dual major). Most of my debt came from 2 years of master’s degree program that I was getting ready to finish. I had 2 semesters left when this happened. I can't finish the degree because I can't get licensed or do the required internship because felony excludes any places I can go to volunteer.\\n\\nThought about taking on another graduate degree, but as I have no intention of paying back, it would be considered a fraud now. While I am a criminal now, I still am hesitant to break the law. I could rack up another $60K in student loans for another graduate degree I can't use in the US.\\n\\nI make about $4 per hour plus tips now working as a server in a small restaurant that I was willing to overlook my past. I can't pay the $210,000 I owe. I am going to leave and never come back. There's nothing left for me here. I have 2 children that I can't see because of a court order for another 4 years. I can't afford the cost to visit the supervised visitation place allowed as I don't have a vehicle to get me that far and I can't really afford the $100+ taxi fare anymore. No public transportation goes there and I have to work weekends so I can't do the 2 hour walk there and the court only allows visits at their mother's convenience. This place was intentionally picked out of my reach. It kills me that I can't see them, but what good is a father who can't give them anything but grief and look of failure. I used to live on revenge, but I love my children too much to hurt their mother. Besides, I am not sure I can do it anyway. I am way more depressed than angry.\\n\\nWhat money I have left, I will use to resettle in another country. I can get by for another year working at this restaurant. Thank goodness that I could find that job. Most places don't hire violent felons. I understand that it is risky for their business. I have been violent once in my life. But it is what I am to others.\\n\\nI know it looks bleak for many and that's what drove you to search out this sub-reddit. It may seem like the bottom can't give out any further, but I wanted to share my story to let you know that maybe you have it better than I do. Not being able to vote reminded me that I can no longer be a citizen in the country that I held dear. Being ripped away from my children out of spite made me really hate myself. Not being able to pay back what I owe made me feel even more worthless. This is my story of why I am leaving. I hope you have a better luck with your life. Don't become a failure like me. I will die in a foreign land somewhere with the long-forgotten memories of my children whom I loved more than my life but I will never see again.\\n\\nAnd for those that are wondering how I can leave my children….\\n\\nI currently live in a group home. I can't rent any place as every place is owned by a company and they do background checks. The list for housing for people like me have a long waitlist. If I didn't have this job, I wouldn't be able to afford this group home. If I don't have an address, I can't get jobs. Can't imagine being able to afford a house anytime soon.\\n\\nI figure this life is going to continue until I get hurt or otherwise disabled. I don't see more than 15-20 years of hard labor. By then, background checks will be mandatory even to become a criminal....\\n\\nWhat good is a father that can't provide for his children? If I barely scrape by only to reach a point that I can't.....then what? Would I beg my children to feed me? Never. I wasn't able to give them anything and I would rather end it all than to be a burden on them. If I stay here, there's nothing guaranteed for me. If I leave and save for the next 10 years, I can give my children $50,000 each for college or to live a life. I have carefully calculated this amount and it is feasible. I don't expect forgiveness for not being around and I don't need anything in return, but I need to provide them with something because I want to be a father to my children. My ex-wife thought she could take this away from me to hurt me, but I refuse to accept it.\\n\\nIf it weren't for them, I would have just ended it all. I want to do this because I need them to know that I care for them. There will be years in between where I will seem worthless. I don't want them to live their lives believing that.\\n\\nNobody here knows that I am planning on leaving. I just had to say it somewhere as I haven't talked to anyone in a while.\",\n",

We got dinner multiple times a week and hung out regularly. We had things going on every weekend. I even thought I had met a girl. She seemed interested in me and we hung out a lot. She made me smile and I was actually happy. \\n\\nThen everything changed. \\n\\nWe all hung out one weekend a few weeks ago. Things became tense due to things outside of our control. People outside the group tried to spread hatred into what we had. But we stuck together and became even closer. It seemed like everyone was by each other’s side. \\n\\nSuddenly and without warning one of the group members dropped off the face of the earth. Deleted Facebook, left all the group messages, and dropped out of contact. Many of us attempted to contact them, but it was no use. No one could figure out what was going on. They were a main facilitator to our group so things quickly fell apart. Things went from hanging out regularly to nothing at all, Hardly even a text from anyone. \\n\\nShortly after I met with the girl I was interested in. She told me some awkward conversations happened in between her and the guy who left the group and she didn’t feel comfortable being a part of the group anymore. She also told me she was seeing someone which was a surprise to me. I should have expected that though. I told her about my depression. Who wants to be with someone who has so many issues...\\n\\n\\nI’m not sure why I wrote this since no one will read it. I guess I just wanted to reflect on things.

My father opened a restaurant in a foreign country and of course you need a partner from that country in order to allow that. It was just one day, so suddenly, we heard from friends that he lost his job and was banned from entering. My dad filed a lawsuit against him but that country takes ages to reply. My father stayed without a job for 6 months while we were suffering. We went through so much, my mothers salary wasn’t much it barely helped us. I went through depression through these 6 months and was suicidal, I even went through ed. \\n\\nAnyways, my father luckily got accepted in to a job luckily but of course the salary wasn’t as much as before. My dad’s work permit was put in hold from his former partner, so he couldn’t take a loan or transfer us money. He did find people to transfer though, luckily, but that didn’t solve our educational issue. At that time we were still in school but we only payed small amount of the fees. Time went by and found out the my father has fortunately won the case but his former partner made an appeal to pay less than the money he took from him. (We were depending on the money to pay our fees but it will only pay out our last year’s fees). My father had no choice but to agree after failed attempted appeal and they set a date to receive his money.\\n\\nThis is the 4th month and my dad didn’t receive the money nor his work permit yet they keep telling his excuses. 4th month my sister, 6th grader, and I, 12th grader, didn’t enter school. My parents are divorced and my mom keeps putting me in pressure to attack my dad for ruining my future and putting us in the low. Ill be honest, my sister and I don’t have a bond with our father, he’s like a bank to us, he doesn’t even talk to us unless he’s transferring money or updating about the court. He has emotionally abused my mom and I also believe the reason why we ended up in this mess was because of him. He doesn’t even have money saved up through the years he’s been working which is why we are suffering. \\n\\nI am a 12th grader who didn’t experience my senior year nor did I start applying for universities because my future is ruined from the hands of my father.  I feel like I have lost everything and it increased my anxiety and destroyed me socially and mentally. I really wish if I could end it all. I know repeating a year is an option but it’s a shame and humiliating. Seeing all my friends graduating and will be in universities while i’m below them destroys me.

I tried telling my wife that I go in and out of these bouts of depression because I have no friends so when she's working and my kid is at school I have no one around. She says I need to try and talk to my old friends from college. She doesn't know it but I've tried. I got a reply a few times from some people but nothing ever ongoing. It always just feels fake and impersonal. \\n\\n I sit at a desk all night long for my job and only interact with the other employees when something is wrong and they need help. There's a few people around my neighborhood that I'm friendly with because of my kid but I'd hardly consider them true friends. \\n\\nCounseling is too expensive and I can't change jobs because like I said, we have another on the way. I don't know what to do and it's crushing me. \\n\\nI'm not sure what I'm trying to get out of this but I wanted to post something. I guess any advice on what I could do, or sites/communities I could try out if you know of anything. \\n\\nStarting to tear up now and I can't let the people at work see me crying so that's all for now.\",\n",
       " 'No matter where I go in life, I always feel like I have absolutely no one. But really, I have everything. A place to live, food to eat, family to love, and a boyfriend to spend my time with. So why do I feel so empty and alone? I moved away from home last year, away from everything and everyone I knew, other than my family who moved with me. I started over, made friends, and got a really amazing boyfriend. But I never stop feeling like it’s just me. No one that loves me, no one to talk to, nothing. I understand that it’s stupid that I feel this way when someone people genuinely have nothing. I’m grateful for what I have, but at this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if I lost it all. I’m so terrified of losing everything that makes life worth living, to the point where I’d rather withdraw from all pleasant things and just suffer. I need help, but medication has yet to help (still trying), and I can’t seem to connect to any therapist I go to (again, still trying). But for the time being, I don’t know what to do.

I know my anxiety has some what always been here, but after I finally decided to get the hell out of a relationship with my girlfriend of nearly 2 years everything in my life started to rapidly fall apart. Nothing seemed wrong with this girl from the beginning she was sweet and good looking but very quickly things started to get scary and I was just too damn weak to stick up for myself or even leave her. Constant physical and psychological  abuse, I wasnt aloud to visit my parents unless she decided kinda shit. I was terrified of her and when I broke things off I was so relieved and felt free. But nothing in my head had changed, I lost trust for everyone I was close with also ended up dropping out of college and totally lost my appetite. Alot of time has passed since I spun out of control and I have made little to no progress on getting my life together, just dont think I'm capable.

       " 'Bear with me this is a bit of a long story. Il make my introduction quick. I’m a 15 year old girl from urban Georgia attending a fairly prestigious high school.\\n\\nWARNING* if you are triggered by thoughts of suicide or self harm please don’t read this\\n\\nI wouldn’t say my life has been particularly tough...except the past few years. In the past few years I’ve had to leave my 9 year long friends and go to a different school, form new friendships, only for them to be broken again when I had to go to another new school because my parents believed it was best. In 7th grade(first year at school number 3) I found out that my mother had developed a drinking problem and had started abusing my father, who never hit her back even though all her abuse. It shook me to my core that someone I trusted so much could simply turn into a monster...I was and still am scared of her. I became withdrawn socially because run my mind “why should I trust more random people around me when they will either leave me behind or could become like my mother.” I fell into a depressive state. I would dig my nails into my wrist to stop myself from crying everyday. Every night I was up til midnight or later, listening to my mother yell at my father for thing he had never done, hearing her throw all sorts of shit against the walls, and finding dents in the morning. I lived in constant fear basically, but 8th grade was when I hit rock bottom. My mother abuse became more physical, she threw a large lamp at him, slapped him in the face with shaving cream when he was sleeping, threw and broke multiply glasses, and scratched whore into the side of two of our cars...one of which I’ll be driving. She had accused him of sleeping with a much MUCH younger co-worker (she was like 20 and he’s in his late forties) which she had no evidence nor reason to believe, because whenever I asked her why she thought that she just said “he is”. She also became a bit abusive towards me, yelling at me for minor things. I became a soulless empty husk all of 8th grade. I honestly don’t remember much since I was a walking mindless zombie. I considered suicide multiply times that year, even thinking about the most painless and quick way to do it. There was a night I was so close to doing it but didn’t have the guts to leave my old sister and father who I both loved so much, behind. I continued to dig my nail into my arm, I started punching my leg and or banging my head on a wall when I was in a bad state. I also started cutting up my arm with my nails, which were pretty long and once cut my leg up with an exacto knife...I hated everything about myself, I couldn’t look myself in the mirror with out sobbing, I had a 2-3 supportive friends at dance, but no one at school had any idea. I faked a quiet smile throughout the whole year. I stopped going to lunch and at a snack in the bathroom. I became unable to handle being in crowds or loud noises (because of my moms yelling I’ve also developed a fear of yelling and have to calm myself down). \\n\\nBeginning 9th grade I slowly started to get better, I began talking to and reaching out to a bit more people at school, which was pretty difficult and took many tries to even speak to others. My sister realized what was going on and had been helping me, I got a bit closer with my sister close friends too. I still struggled at feeling useless and I hated watching myself dance even though I’m at a pre professional level, I forgot to mention earlier but I dance 5-6 days a week 9am-5pm on Saturdays and am a soloist in my student company, but i have become a bit more comfortable with my looks. I’ve remember the first time I genuinely laughed since 7th grade. I wasn’t close friends with anyone at school but I felt more comfortable commenting on people’s posts and texting them to ask questions. I stopped letting people take advantage of me ( people would ask for me to buy them food and then be like “omg you are so my best friend thank you so much!!” ). I’m still healing and have many scars. My father snapped and told me mother he wants a divorce, he attitude changed completely once she realized he was serious, because she knew I would want to go with him and she cleaned up her act trying to act all nice and buy me things so I would break him more than she ever could but I didn’t and simply pushed back at her. I’m no longer scared of my mother, she’s raise me to be intelligent which sucks for her cause I now can fight back with legitimate facts and reason, I can now stand up for myself and am not afraid to yell at her at the top of my lungs. I would say I’m okay. But I’m not.\\n\\nMy sister is leaving for collage and I’m scared since she has been my main support leg. My dance studio is falling apart and all three of my other support legs, my best friends in the world. Are ll moving away to pursue dance at a non toxic studio( whole different story there ). I’m getting shaken up again because like I said earlier, I have a bit of a fear of people leaving me behind, and all my support legs are slipped just as I’m trying to build new ones. I’m so scared of what’s gonna happen, I’m scared of falling back into depression, I want to live but sometimes it doesn’t seem worth it still to this day. I’m scared please help. Everything I’ve done and fought through feels like it’s crumbling and I feel like im gonna retreat back into my shell. I know this was long but I have no other place to turn to and would appreciate some advice.\\n\\n\\nEdit: I also want to get this off my chest, I was in a relationship with a fun quirky guy who made me laugh, we were best friends in a relationship. But when we went to different schools we broke it off. I’ve tried keeping in contact but it kinda connects to me feeling left behind. I know I’m young, people will say it’s stupid but it’s been a year or so and I still miss him, I think I might have even loved him. I don’t know how to move on...I scared of being left behind again. There’s a guy at my new school I kinda like but I don’t want to seem annoying.',\n",

       " 'I’m new here to Reddit, don’t exactly know how this place works, but I needed to get some stuff off my chest and hopefully get some answers on how to get better. \\n\\nI’m an 18 year old girl, graduated in June of 2019 and have always felt empty. And when I’m not feeling empty I just feel sad or angry at how my life was growing up.  I was raised in an abusive household, my mother being a violent drunk and my dad never being home, since he hated dealing with her. \\n\\nEvery “friend” I’ve had has either hurt me physically, talked about me behind my back, started rumors, or was just always rude ever since I was in elementary school. Despite that, there were moments when they made me feel happy and that things would be okay. Then after high school ended last year, I got tired and dropped my only best friend because of how toxic she was. \\n\\nShe kept me from making other friends, was sexual with any guy I came into contact with that was interested in me, and even threatened other people “not to touch her girlfriend” (me). No we weren’t dating, but she always made people stay away from me my entire school career since the 6th grade all the way up to 12th, even told me to break up with my first “boyfriend”, which I did because she was my friend, but then they started dating a few days later. (Which is why I don’t count him. Plus we were like 11, so it wasn’t that serious anyway.) Even then I stayed with her till the end, was the third wheel in all her relationships, took all the toxicity to the point that I never trusted anyone again, and never got into a relationship I order to please her. Yes I’ve been single basically my whole life. I’ve never even been kissed. \\n\\nWhen I told her that we weren’t good for each other last year after we graduated she literally sobbed, but I felt nothing because of all the hurt she made me feel. She talked about me negatively, kept people from me, did things with the guys I would start talking to, then ditch me whenever she could and I’d just be alone until she needed to rant about her problems. \\n\\nMy dad also became very verbally abusive when my mom ran away when I was around 12, and it has really affected my opinion on men, along with the guys who insisted they were into me, but easily got swept up by sexual desire when it came to my ex-best friend if she offered herself. \\n\\nNot only that, but when I was a toddler I was sexually abused/harassed/assaulted. By my babysitter and her boyfriend, which has also caused a bit of trauma when it comes to trusting people. And in elementary school I was cornered at a fence by older boys, luckily I got away, then another time in elementary I was pinned down by a boy my age, got away by kicking him where the sun don’t shine. Then when I was in foster care at around age 9, an entire group of older boys surrounded me, held me by my arms and legs as one tried to get between my thighs. I had never been so scared in my life, but have always been a fighter, so I got away by, once again, kicking him where the sun don’t shine, which pretty much caused the boys to try and help him up, giving me time to escape as I kicked and scratched my way out. When I did though, I ended up scraping my back by hiding under some type of wooden thing and have a small scar on my back because of it. \\n\\nDuring high school I just got the usual cliché foot being rubbed up my leg by some douche, or the slow gravitation of the hand up my thigh to my crotch type of thing by some horny jerk. Not too serious, but still very god damn scary since you feel trapped even though you’re in a classroom with a teacher at their desk. \\n\\nI could have asked for help, but my whole life I had always been forced to keep quiet and deal with things myself, since my friends didn’t care, my parents never cared, not even the teachers I told that I was being abused at home when I was in elementary cared, which made me not trust adults with authority. The only time I did get help was when I got put into an all women’s home when I was little, because my mom lied saying my dad was the abusive one when it was her. \\n\\nHowever, each time I was put back with my family. I didn’t stay in the all women’s home, or foster care where a lot of other bad stuff happened, I still ended up with my verbally abusive dad, who always wanted me to be perfect. I got excellent grades all through out high school, never ditched, was always above the class in physical education, but even then, my dad called me an average person. That I wasn’t special. And it sent me back to when my mom told me I was an accident, and the times he told me I was an accident and basically was supposed to be given up for adoption. \\n\\nI grew up being told I wasn’t supposed to be here, and now, naturally believe that I don’t mean anything. What happens to me doesn’t matter. I exist to be used and tossed away. Every guy has only wanted me for my body, every “friend” only wanted me because I was there when they needed some cash or when they needed to rant. I exist for my dad to keep using me to take care of my 5 sisters, to cook, to clean, to do laundry. That’s all I’ve been doing since I was 8. Cooking, cleaning, raising kids...is that really all I’m good for? \\n\\nIs that really why I’m here? I love to draw, but my dad says that my art is pointless. I’ve done everything I could to make him proud of me, but every time I make an effort to actually leave and grow up he makes me feel like I’m worthless and won’t make it. I haven’t even been able to get a job of my own, because he wouldn’t give me my birth certificate or social security card. Luckily I got them myself, but I even bought a car with money I saved up, and he won’t let me touch the keys. I bought it in August. It hasn’t even been driven by me yet. Recently I even paid for my ID and my permit test, which amounted to about $70 with the money I saved up from my grandparents as gifts since they can never visit. I’ve paid for everything myself, gotten things myself, but he won’t let me do anything. I even got a scholarship, applied to college and got in before high school ended, but he sent me to my grandmas the day I had to get my scholarship money and then he made me drop my college classes after I came back from her place. \\nI even planned on living in the dorms and getting a part time job as I took my classes at the college. \\n\\nWhat do I do? I feel like I should just end everything since I know nobody will ever actually love me for me, and I know that I’ll just get taken advantage of again even if I leave my dad and sisters. \\n\\nI’ll end up alone, and homeless since I can’t even go into a store without being paranoid a man will ultimately assault me, because I’ve been followed in a store, and ogled since before I even hit puberty, which has added to my already severe social anxiety.\\n\\nMy 11 year old sister even noticed a guy following us and stood right behind me because she realized he was staring right at my behind, then followed us out of the store a few months ago. I didn’t even know that was why she was standing so close to me before she told me once we got in the car together. I thought I had been the only one who noticed a guy was being creepy because she’s still so young, but I guess she’s old enough to know when someone has bad intentions.\\n\\nShe always offers to go to the store with me because she knows how scared I get when alone. \\n\\nMaybe I need therapy? I know it’s not normal for my social anxiety to be this bad. I even stutter while talking to my family. \\n\\nWhat can I do to fight off all of my trauma and anxiety, so I can function like a normal person in society? I want a job, I want to drive without being scared due to flashbacks from when my mom would drink and drive with me in the car when I was little. I want to trust a guy and love him unconditionally.

       " 'I (24,f) was in an abusive relationship for 4 years that ended 2 years ago and, as a result, I am on antidepressants. I won’t go into details but it was physically and emotionally abusive to the point I was either beaten up or told to kill myself daily (or that I’m ugly, disgusting, nobody loves me, etc). \\n\\nMy problem is the following... I don’t talk to any of my old friends because of it. I am so ashamed of what I did (promising everyone I’d never go back to him but doing the opposite + everyone knowing me as the poor girl who got beaten up a lot) that I stopped talking to them and they stopped contacting me in return. Which is relatively okay since I moved to another country last year anyway and I had the opportunity to make new friends. And yet, I couldn’t. I tried to attend parties and they all resulted into me getting panic attacks and having to leave. It usually happened when guys tried to approach me.\\n\\nWhich leads this to my next problem... I have low self-esteem issues and, even though I’m not the ugliest on earth since I get stared at or hit on every once in a while, I still feel like every guy wants to fool me or harm me somehow every time they approach me. Like I don’t consider myself pretty enough for more than a hookup. I know it’s an irrational fear and just because I dated the wrong person doesn’t mean that everyone is the same. But I can’t stop it. I also noticed that because of my fear of men/dating, I refuse social situations if they involve parties or any of that stuff. And people stop contacting me when I don’t go to their birthdays, etc.\\n\\nI’m writing this because I seriously don’t know how to get over this issue. I always thought that giving it time could heal it, but it’s been two years and I become more fearful with each passing day. The antidepressants are good because I don’t feel suicidal anymore, but it’s not like I’m living that much either. \\n\\nI feel like I left a lot of the stuff out but I didn’t want to make this way too long. If anyone has any advice on how to get over it, I’d gladly appreciate it.',\n",

I was 6 or 7 at the time.\\n\\nMy present/new family I was fostered when I was 3 by the family I have now. But I still got to go to meetings with my birth mom. (They were awful) I was ten adopted by the family I have now. My cousin tried to rape me when I was 8 and he was 12. Now I hate to be touched, especially by boys. My cousin has issues. so when I started screaming and my auntie caught him, I got in trouble by her because I told her he was hurting me. She never told anyone, and because I got in trouble, I thought it was my fault so I didnt tell anyone ether. Now I still have to see him. I flinch every time he hugs me or kisses me on the cheek. It makes me sick, and turns my stomach.\\n\\nMy adoptive mom later had two boys. One is 8 and the other is 6. I hate them both, but I hate the 8 year old one more. Im a terrible sister and a burden to everyone who knows me. Im annoying and when people ditch me I go crawling back to them like some pathetic dog. Even if it was never my fault. Im always apologizing to people and it annoys the shit out of them. Im emotionally unstable, have terrible anger issues, and really bad mood swings. Im suicidal and have 3 failed attempts. I was hospitalized 3 times, 2 for suicide attempts, 1 for running away. My grandma is mean to me and looks hat me like she is just utterly disgusted with my existence, or presence. Im super clingy, and love hugging/ touching people (They let me, they understand) Their is an aching in my heart that never really goes away. I cry myself to sleep. I want to die. But im to scared to kms. I wish I had the guts to do it. But I just dont. Like I mentioned earlier. Im here for 4 people right now.

What comes next is real. My breathing, however, rather than bringing relief, only allows me to think somewhat clearer as I now form full sentences with the struggle of reason and maybe, just maybe, a hint of truth. I continue nonetheless, surging forth as every action now becomes a burden. Every step. Every breath. Every thought. \\n\\nI gaze up at the overhead light. It’s bright and I squint my eyes closed, and I push further. As I continue, looking onward now, I begin to realize that the light was not so blinding, but rather dim in the hallway. Perhaps it was the dark effect upon my eyes that made the light so blaring and offensive. I squeeze my eyelids shut and forget the matter. I need to move forward. I must move on. \\n\\nOne foot, being my left, is now ahead of the rest of my body. My thoughts begin to race more and more. “What will it be like?” “What will happen?” I use my right foot to push myself forward until I gain traction again in my left, and continue the motion in that foot. “What am I going to do now?” Tears are now welling up in my eyes. I know because the light had dried them up. \\n\\nThis is more than an issue of dry eyes, however. Rather than my body naturally stopping the flow of tears, upon which my eyes become wet again, they proceed to flow forth. I feel this in my subconscious, but my conscious mind is occupied elsewhere. My heart, now following the path of my brain, now beats forcefully, moving me to panic. I know that I need to calm down. My head begins to feel light and swirly. I grab hold of the wall, flattening my hand upon its cool surface. I bend down and catch my breath once more. I pause for maybe a second or two, dreading what is to become of me. \\n\\nMy conscious mind, now updated to the previous conditions, struggles to interpret my bodily reactions. Fear? No. Anxiety? Of sorts, but not nearly as strong as the feeling of--\\n\\nMy hand that was once on the wall now grabs an icy cold door handle. My body shudders and my mind goes blank. I turn the frozen mechanism until its counterpart releases the door to be opened. No thoughts. No feeling. This was it. I feel the atmosphere change as I push forward upon the door. The darkness retreats to the faint light of the hallway, and I see it. \\n\\nOne foot steps into the room. The revealing light, still dim, peels back the darkness to show my naked eyes what fate that I would behold. It’s an empty apartment. My thoughts continue, slowly now, as the tears still flow down the sides of my face. The feeling that I had felt was sadness. No danger existed in the apartment-- that is, until I entered into the room.',\n",

I don’t really regret that decision I believe school to be a very important, especially because I have always aspired to wards prestige which really is just a sign of my insecurity’s ‘if I can’t make you like me I can outshine you. The consequences of my choice means that I am more or less socially isolated with no intimate friends in sight.

I take the train home. When I come home I go straight to bed to sleep or watch YouTube for several hours because I’m too exhausted to do anything else. Repeat five days a week all year long.\\n\\nAs some of you can imagine that this existence of mine hasn’t been all happy (hence why am posting in this subreddit) but I was never really proper low, I never cut myself (although I did punch myself on Acacian) I was thinking I suicidal thoughts but I wasn’t serious about it I never tried, I wanted to live. It doesn’t change that I wasn’t  happy. I’m talking in the past tense but I might as well talk in present tense it’s just that hindsight is easier.\\n\\n\\nNow the title of this post ‘is not depressed enough’  so let me tell you about that. \\n\\nAs a person with all these fancy diagnoses I have contact with the psychiatric care. I do have the occasional but meeting but those are not about my psyche, it’s  to check on my medicine. I tell them about my struggles but nothing happens. Mostly because of my decent grades. If we are extra annoying they will give me a good for nothing meeting, to shut my mother up.

I started having a crush on him solely based on his humor and his voice. We started \"dating\" the day after we met and we were inseparable for a few months. It took a while to show each other what we looked like but we both found each other attractive. He got a PS4 and moved on from PS3 where I was stuck, so the only way we would talk was on FaceTime and snapchat. This is right around the time we were discovering sexual things so we ended up sending each other nudes at like 14/15 years old. My dad found out and took my phone in March of 2016. It was taken until the end of the summer. We reconnected when I got it back and it was like we never stopped talking.

       " \"It's been a couple months since my last depressive episode, I was doing great, I was focusing on school, socializing, (thought) I was patching things up with my family and was generally speaking feeling pretty good about everything. However this pandemic has pulled me all the way back to where I was months ago, all my hard work wasted. I'm scared. I have never been that low before, during those months I had been hospitalized, attempted suicide on multiple occasions and felt nothing except the urge to be gone. I don't want to go back to that, the feeling of complete helplessness, feeling like no matter what I do I can't get out of this hole I'm in, despite wanting to more than ever. I always know that things are going to get better, I know I won't be in this much pain constantly but I don't know if it's worth it. Sure, I'll miss out on things, never get to experience the things my friends will in the future but is it really worth it? Going through months on numbness, pain, sadness when all I get in return is a month or two of feeling okay? I used to want to die while I was happy because I knew in the future I would feel like shit again but of course I could never bring myself to do it because at the time I was content. Anyway, back to the present, I can feel myself slipping back into my old habits now that I am in isolation, self harm, not eating properly etc. I feel like my life is ruined, I can't see a future for myself anymore. I don't want to die but I also don't want to live anymore. Ideally I would just disappear, leave everything, all my responsibilities, family, everything. Start fresh. But I know that's selfish and unfair and wouldn't solve the problem, just put it off until I feel the need to escape again. Isolation has been very difficult for me considering the only things that actually helped was being able to see my friends, since I don't get along with the family I live with. I am now realizing how much I rely on drugs, not only to numb myself but to simultaneously make me feel something. I don't really know what to do. For some reason I have completely isolated myself from all my friends, I don't think I've talked to any of them in about a week (I'm not really sure why to be honest). I really do not get along with my family, for no other reason except the fact that my mother thinks I'm a fuck up, which is completely possible but I believe we jut don't have the same values. I don't know. All I know is that in the end my death is inevitable, it's just a matter of when.\\n\\nSorry my writing is a mess, if you actually read all that, I think I just needed an outlet.\\n\\nAlso I know that as soon as I move out I'll hopefully feel a lot better, my mother is really the cause of, or at least makes my mental health a lot worse however that isn't a possibility as I'm only 16.\\n\\nMy mother knows about my mental health and how bad I'm doing yet refuses to help or even recognize it, despite me being diagnosed as she is worried it will tarnish the family reputation as well as my own. I guess I have a good life, I'm very lucky to be considered attractive, I'm popular, always been selected to be in the highest grade football team, unlike some people on here who complain about being lonely or how they think they deserve are monsters because they have never kissed a girl. No, I know I'm very privileged to be in the position I'm in, I have nothing to complain about, I've had girlfriends all through school as well as doing relatively well in all my classes. Yet somehow, despite the fact that my life is so good I can't find it in myself to be happy. My family thinks everything I do is for attention, my suicide attempts, getting arrested, everything. But it's not. They think that because I have a good life I should be happy and they're right. But I'm not.\\n\\nEdit: If you read this please just say something, anything. I honestly just need some kind of recognition that how I'm feeling is valid.\",\n",

The friends I do have are not very close friends, mostly friends by circumstance, but I fear that I cling to these fragile friendships, probably too much in their eyes, because I'm so terrified to be alone. I look at people who have big friend groups and I don't know how they do it, most people I think could be good friends turn out to be stuck in that petty highschool mindset of I'm better than you so will somehow put you down. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI guess my low self-esteem comes from both lack of friends and lack of being able to keep the friendships I do have. This is where I wonder if I'm the problem. Is it my personality that puts people off? I honestly don't know. For example: when it was my birthday a couple of years ago, I was the youngest of the group so pretty excited to finally be turning 16, looking back I don't know why, earlier in the year I had gone all out for my best friend at the time. When it came to mine, I didn't understand why nobody had done something similar, I wasn't expecting a big huge present like I had got them (maybe hoping, but not expecting). Even a pizza lunch would have made my day, which was something we did for our friends birthdays, later after my birthday, I found out that a group chat had been made to organize it but my close friends at the time soon decided I talked too much about my birthday so they weren't going to get me anything past a card. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs you can imagine I was extremely hurt, not to mention this was one of the reasons I started to spiral hard into depression. Honestly, I don't think my self-esteem has really built up since them, I constantly doubt myself, if I'm talking too much, not listening enough, putting enough/too much effort into friendships. I have since changed friend groups of which I have since kept friends with 2-3 people after leaving for university. At university I didn't find as many friends as I thought I would, has anyone been in a similar situation? I guess I just don't know if I'm so lonely/depressed because of self-sabotage or not. But by God does loneliness and depression creep up on you at the weirdest and most inopportune of times. Has anyone been in a similar situation? If so, please give me advice on what I'm doing wrong.\",\n",

When the sun came up, as I stayed up all night, I got ready for school; put my death letters on my desk; and prepared to say my goodbye's to my friends. When I looked in the mirror while I was getting ready it had hit me what I had done. I had begun to end my life, when I am only very young and have not even experienced the majority of my life. I broke down in tears and went downstairs and told my parents I had overdosed. We immediately went to the ER and I told ym parents I was sorry and that I knew it was too late as the medicine was already into my system. They couldn't pump my stomach because, as I had said, it was too late. The last thing I remember was eating scrambled eggs and then proceeding to throw them up. After 5 minutes I had my first seizure. My dad was the only one in the room with me besides the nurse. The nurse had no idea what to do and immediately ran for the doctor. All my father could do was sit there and watch me as my eyes rolled back into my head and I started to die. I was medivaced to the ICU at Vidant medical center which is a leading hospital where my father had previously been treated at. I survived through that seizure and had multiple smaller ones over the course of two days. I do not remember those days. Apparently I was awake but I was out of it and I was hallucinating. I was transferred to the pediatric ward after another day when I was stable but still throwing up. After 3 days in the pediatric unit I was medically stable and able to keep food down so I was transferred to Bryn Marr mental hospital. I stayed there for a week during my treatment and was released today. I realized, while I was in there, the result of my actions. I effected my parents and my closest friends. My father said to me that he continues to have flashbacks of me on the table in the ER having my seizure and that he cried himself to sleep nearly everynight for the past 2 weeks. I hope my story has made some of you re-think suicide. It is not worth it and life will never be that bad. Please think about what you are doing and please consider the effects and the destruction you will cause if you go through with it. Life will always get better. I can't take back what I did and I can't take back the sadness, grief, and heartache I have caused the ones around me and the guilt of that will stay with me forever.

Why are you denying that you are depressed that I've went fullout crying right on like I haven't done in forever. It felt so good. I feel so much better now. That dam I built around my heart.

I’m a sad, broken person. But that’s who I am. I’m wasting away my life doing nothing but stare at my screen and recently, being on my phone to try and entertain and distract myself from how I feel just isn’t cutting it anymore. I’m tired of the situation I’m in, I actually hate it... but I’m going to have to bring some light into the darkness I’m feeling. At least try and turn it around to be better than it is instead of dwelling with it. I can’t do social media right now, I’m going to try and cut it out of my life for a bit. Just so I can get myself together so that I’m strong enough to not go out onto the internet and make another stupid post that no one will actually read all the way through about how sad I am. I want to be happy, but at the same time I have this urge to just crawl back into this fucking shit hole I’ve dug myself in. The hole I dug myself when I suddenly realized that my life was crumbling because of me. Because I was weak, because I was open to the negativity that flooded my life. That throughout the last semester of my freshman year of constantly crying myself to sleep that I was the one that was scared of getting the help I needed until it was too late. I wanted someone to notice... to take the burden off my shoulders, instead of telling them my pain because I was too scared to say it. Because I didn’t want to feel vulnerable to others. I’ve tried online therapy that ended into me not wanting to go to a therapist at all even though I know not all therapist were like the “therapist” I met on (not gonna directly say the name because I don’t want them coming for me) *Greater*help (you know which one of talking about) . Help my ass. \\nI’m thinking about drawing again, trying new things to help my moral. Something to make me a better happier person than the one I am right now. \\nIts going to take a while, I know, but it will be worth it. \\nI’m just trying to figure out how I’m just going to work this all out really. My feelings to be exact, because it really is a roller coaster. I’m thinking about actually telling my parents, I think just my mom... but I do need to tell my dad. My dads current suffering from depression severe ptsd, and is bipolar and I don’t want to add more pain onto him, that in fact his daughter is a totally mess and depressed all the time. \\nI need therapy, I know. My depression isn’t as severe as before but the scars are still there and I really can’t move on if I don’t completely understand my emotions and how they work. I’ll update this when I do get myself together hopefully. I didn’t really want to post this but really... I’m writing this for me. So, for the poor individual that stumbled upon this.

You are limitless and cannot be pushed down. \\n\\nHolding yourself in a higher light is powerful. But it takes awareness. We must experience enough of the pain before we understand who we really are, which is pure energy, pure light. When we realize how great each of us really is, we can start to take responsibly for our actions. We can see how our actions affect those around us because everyone around us looks up to us in one way or another, its true. Some look up to us for our humor, some see us with a strong work ethic and wonder how to pick up on that, or others may re-enact our demeanor when we are at our best. \\n\\nAt our best we are unstoppable. When we stay focused and attain right living, right thought and right action, we become what most would define as noble and courageous. We actually defy what culture is telling us is normal. In a way we are stubborn, saying no to the norm, but those wallowing in the norm see us and wonder how they do it, just like we wondered how our role models did it. \\n\\nBecome your own role model. Become something great, it’s really not that hard to do. Once you understand that greatness is your natural state, all thats left to do is act on it. Claim whats rightfully yours. \\n\\n\\nYou have immeasurable power within you. What does that mean and how do you get it?\\n\\nIt means that you are made up of energy. What runs your body and mind, the driver behind the life your in, is pure energy. You are made up of knowing, intuition, responsibility, joy, all of it is you and your natural state. \\n\\nHow do you tap into that. How do you get the sap from this tree. Believe. First start by believing in yourself and what your trying to do. Everything starts with an initial idea, a first thought. Even depression begins with a thought. Take what you want in life and tell yourself it can be done. Say it outloud \"I can do this.\" Because you can if you believe it. \\n\\nTapping into that power, into the real you, is just a matter of being aware it exists and trying to see it. Once we start seeing life through this new vision, we see it more and more. Soon you will notice moments in your day when you could have reacted, but you didn\\'t. You will notice timing to be precise, people react differently to you, life begins to unfold the way you want, naturally. \\n\\nIve seen this and I live this way. There are many ways to go about this. Once you become aware of this truth and start believing in it, you will generally never be able to regress into your old self. There will be slips and falls, of course there has to be, but we no longer get down and disappointed. We use the challenges as stepping stones to become stronger. \\n\\n**I know you are amazing. I wish you knew that too. Someone out there right now envies you for something. Someone wishes they could have some aspect of your character. Without even realizing it, people depend on us. And if this is just projection, then I\\'m projecting the most loving, warm, heartfelt feeling right at you. I am blasting you with all the love I have got. Because you do matter, you are important, you will change someones life one day, you will get what you want, it is only a matter of positive self-perception and hard work. You are capable beyond understanding. We all are.**',\n",

I never spoke much, but whenever I did, no one seemed to make much sense out of it. So I spent my days alone. Never talked much to anyone during holidays, just sat in the room playing games and streaming Netflix.\\nThen, suddenly I had a crush on this girl. I didn't tell her because who would want a shit like me and also, cause she was in a relationship already. But then, towards the end of last year, around Christmas, I just started texting her. And things went pretty well. Then I finally I told her that I have a crush on her. She said she too had a crush on me. And then soon she proposed me. And things were like a fairy tale. And then all of a sudden, she dumped me. I knew one day she would dump me, it was inevitable. But I didn't expect it would hurt so much. And then I got really depressed. But then one day I took a day off from school and just read a blog by Mark Manson (the author of The subtle art of not giving a fuck) and then I felt happy, and cheerful and thought I will soon get over it. But here's the Uncomfortable truth: She dumped me cause she wanted to go back with her ex. And now everyday I need to see them together in school and believe me it feels like putting salt over your open wound. \\nI feel so horrible. If she had to go back with her ex then why get into relationship with me in the first place. I mean my life was going fine before. I didn't deserve this pain. Also, this makes me question my self-worth. I feel like I would never be enough for anyone. \\nThanks for your time. Have a great day\",\n",

       " \"I know this is gonna be harsh but I envy people who are depressed without a reason. They probably just need a medication and therapy to get better. I can't do that as it won't change anything. At best, I will just stop caring about my shitty life. Here are all \\\\[or just half\\\\] of the reasons why I don't wanna live anymore.\\n\\nCHILDHOOD\\n\\nFucked up, I was beaten, screamed at, my parents should have divorced years ago. It was toxic and made me angsty, insecure, socially disabled girl. No real friends, I have always talked to myself and my imaginary boyfriends or friends and I still do. Once I finally left for college I felt lost. I stopped feeling constant fear but had no mental resources to make any real friends or relationships.\\n\\nI have experienced multiple rejections \\\\[emotional, romantic, career-related\\\\] at this stage of life and never got over it. The only thing I was good at was school. Nobody gives a shit about you if you are no trouble maker, just a moderately talented, extremly shy girl. I was so alone and disscociated I could talk to myself for hours.\\n\\nWe were poor so no fancy clothes, holidays, family activities or any experiences a normal teenager should have. My parents tried hard at that point, and I don't wanna blame them, but finally poverty got to them and they just destroyed their relationship and whole family. They have never taught me how to be a productive, active person with goals and a talent for earning money. I come home twice a year, for a day or two. I know they are hurt, but I am so sick of their yells and constant humiliation.\\n\\nRELATIONSHIPS\\n\\nI've been rejected by people I was in love with.  I am just too ugly, too weird, too shy. I confessed being bisexual to my parents and it was a living hell. I have never mentioned it again. My first and only relationship started when I was 23 - we're now engaged but I don't wanna get married \\\\[no money for it, too much anxiety over family issues, difficulties with taking responsibility and organizing anything, I literally cry when I think about it.\\\\] Simple, low-cost wedding is out of question - his family wants a real party. So we're getting nowhere, it just a stalemate.\\n\\nNow I have crushes for fictional characters and I still long for one person I was really infatuated with.\\n\\nI and my fiancee were happy but now I think I just desperately wanted to be with someone after my severe breakdown related to lack of any romantic relationship. I had no money, no chances for a job or place to live and I felt so unhappy and lost that he was a real savior. Wonderful man, true gentleman. He just doesn't know how to deal with my depression anymore and it starts to affect him. We are living together for over 5 years and I don't wanna end this as we do have so much in common and, let's face it, it's just easier for someone so severely depressed to be dependant. I know I am cruel, but without him I'd be long since dead.\\n\\nI do have some people who wanna see me and meet up but I no longer can catch up with them financially, emotionally, in terms of having a nice job, home, children. I don't wanna see their success as it only hurts me more.\\n\\nWORK/CAREER\\n\\nI am 30 years old, working in a shitty recruitment outsouring office I hate. I hate everything about this job and I can't change it. I tried to find a job for over 3 years after I finished my useless master degree and no luck. I tried applying my dream jobs, I tried to be a freelance copywriter, I tried to have a blog with some income. I just wasn't good enough for any of those and if not for my former colleague I would not be accepted here as well. I can't and don't want to be promoted as I barely stand my current duties.\\n\\nI am financially dependent on my fiancee as I would not be able to pay for my place without him. I earn very little comparing to my co-workers because I don't have strength, motivation and courage to ask for a raise or to constantly change jobs.\\n\\nGOALS\\n\\nAs mentioned above I have no career goals. Any other ones are just out of my reach. I feel like having a constant fatigue syndrome. Add social anxiety and travelling & going out is nearly impossible. I wish I could travel and see some world, but I cry and get scared off at the moment of booking plane tickets. I have actually been away for a few days and it was scary as hell, I came back so stresssed out.\\n\\nI wish I could have a home or an apartment but I don't have money. I'd love to be a housekeeper, to pick up decor, furniture, wall paint, to make a home. We are saving up for years and fucking prices just get up higher and higher. Every year our goal is getting further away. I live in a shitty, old, one room apartment and we can't even rent up something better because then we couldn't save cash anymore.\\n\\nI am 30 years old with little chances to get married or have a home so I gave up hope for a baby as well. We can't afford wedding and apartment, how can we afford a baby? After all I am a fucked up adult kid myself, how could I be a good mother for someone else?\\n\\nLOOKS/ Other issues\\n\\nI have no energy, no motivation, all I do for years is playing games in my free time. I can't force myself onto some sort of effort to do anything else. I tried some easy going sports, I gave up after a day or two. I got fat, and I have still not overcome my teenage insecurities. I hate my body as well which impacts my sex life and social life. I have never had an orgasm with my partner and I've stopped trying.\\n\\nI feel extremly weak, physically and mentally and I hear people telling me this as well. You're lazy, you are not resilient, you're neurotic. You want an easy life.  I have a perfectionist OCD.\\n\\nI am no longer surprised or disappointed when something in my life blows up. What did you expect, you stupid bitch? You're a failure, it's just another one. I wish I could reload my life as a different character. I've been living so long with depression, neuroses and anxiety that I don't want to know who I'd be without them. Definitely not myself.\\n\\nI have my first psychiatrist appointment within a few weeks and I hope he'll just give me meds that will make me indifferent. I hope I won't run away. It's fucking expensive but I decided either that or I will kill myself. He can't change my shitty life and I can't change it either.\",\n",

Like sure. Yes. But sometimes I just want to be able to cry to a friend and here that it’s ok. Just tired of suppressing my feelings because “being sad isn’t who I am”. \\n\\nI recognized I shouldn’t rely on anyone to make me feel better but really, I just wish that I had someone I could turn to for the company. Not someone who is going to tell me to just get over it as I “should know” crying isn’t gonna help my problems. Really sucks sometimes.',\n",

Though it took a while I managed to find a good sales job it was base plus commission.\\n\\nI did that job for a few years but unfortunately last year the place I worked at went out of business so everyone was laid off. Luckily I had 40k saved up in my bank account just because I was smart enough to live as cheap as possible. Anyway during that period I couldn’t find another job, I submitted tons of applications, I went to temping agencies but each job I had through them was only temporary. I then came across an old acquaintance  who asked if I was interested in starting a business. I was very hesitant at first but after a couple months of thinking and some desperation I agreed and put up the money for it. \\n\\nObviously that business failed and now I feel so stupid because it should have been common sense from the start going into a business with no prior knowledge about running one. I let my old business partner persuade me into something that I regret deeply. By the time we closed the place I had less than 2 grand left in my bank account. Even with cheap rent I knew it was only enough for a few months. And I couldn’t find another job within the first two months. Not only did I lose all that money but my girlfriend left me and called me a loser for it. It still hurts thinking about it. \\n\\nNow I’m back living at home depressed and anxious because I’m unsure about what to do next. I’m now doing gig work like Uber,lyft, and doordash, just to get some money coming in. And as mentioned earlier in the post, I’m starting to have a mental break down. Because I really don’t know what to do. I keep applying to new places and even with experience sometimes I feel like it’s because I don’t have a Bachelors which I can’t afford to go back to school because I honestly have no money. Ive been waking up with anxiety every morning the last few months. Right now I’m honestly just completely lost and don’t know what to do. Nothing makes me happy anymore.

The other type of Barbwire that wraps so harshly that it puts almost everybody down for the count sometime in their life.  Some have it worse then others.   Some just shrug it off, others are out of commission for years.  Its a fact of life for all of us.  But for some it is life.   Just like all those fake videos on how to get rich or the magic cure to losing weight; I'm going to bloat this post with some background on myself.  Only I won't ask you to buy some bullshit book at the end.  I promise I'll get to why I went through the trouble to post in the end.\\n\\nFirst a lil information about myself.  I'm a 35 year old hypothyroidism, clinically bipolar with episodes of social anxiety, manic depression, low energy, sometimes abnormally high energy male.  I have not let this stop me though.  For the most part I live a happy life with a girlfriend and 3kids. Shit... I have 3 kids.  Expensive little buggers they are but I love them. Christmas has me bankrupt.  And honestly a little worried. \\n\\nSo who am I though?  If you were to ask my gf she would say many things. Loving father,  god in bed, worried about everything I should be, energetic sometimes asshole, lazy, and depressing.  Wait, nevermind.  She would not say any of that.  She would say he is just him.  We love each other for who we are.  All of it the good and the bad.  And in that way I am lucky. \\n\\nIf I were to tell you how I feel I am.  I would say multiple people trapped in one body.  Multiple emotions fighting for attention trapped inside a brain who has no control over what emotion will win.   I wake up in the morning not knowing how I'll feel before bed.  I go to bed not knowing what the emotion wheel will land on in the morning.  I have learnt to mask the bad sides.  If anything for the kids.  And I do do that well.  But on the inside I really am a mess.  Will the kids eventually figure out my bluff.  Yes, I'm sure they will.  But, hopefully not till there old enough to handle it.  If there is such an age.  \\n\\nI do this all unmedicated.   Should I be on mood stabilizers?  That's a matter of opinion.  But like most of you.  I tired of the bullshit numb feeling that comes with it.   What is the point of not feeling the lows if it takes away the highs with it?  \\n\\nNow to the point.   How do I deal?  Again its all the small things.   Have you ever been depressed and got the will to take a hot shower.   Lather up and feel it run down your body as it washes up.   How about men out there.   Shaving.  Am I crazy?  Maybe.  But shaving.  The smell of the foamy cream.   The feel of a clean shaved neck.  No matter the mood.  I can always appreciate a good shave.  \\n\\nNo matter how much shit this world throws at us. How much like shit we feel.   Please find the small things.  Force yourself, no matter how hard it is to do anything.   Force yourself to do those small things you enjoy.   You may be surprised on how much better you may feel after.\\n\\nNOW BUY MY FUCKING BOOK.  It will make you rich.  Or me rich I forget.\\n\\n\\nPlease if life gets to hard and you think you will end it .  Seek help.  People are around.  Good people that don't judge.  You are worth everything.  No matter what bullshit the imbalances tell you.  \\n\\nHope you all had an at least ok Thanksgiving.  \\n\\nL3\",\n",

I don\\'t think I was 100% ready to talk to a stranger about my deepest and darkest feelings just yet.

However, there has been some setbacks that make each attempt I make more discouraging. \\n\\nI decided on therapy in the summer but was having issues with my insurance for the longest time. Once I got it situated the semester had already started at my uni, so I just decided to use their free counseling service for students. The huge downside was that scheduling just an intake appointment was such a hassle; the first time I called, the receptionist \"scheduled\" my appointment at the time that the office was going to be closed. I didn\\'t know until I walked in on the day of and the whole place was empty. After I tried a second time, I was able to successfully secure an appointment. Only this time, after I had finished, the therapist suggested that it would probably be best that I seek long-term care at a private practice outside of campus. Plus, their waitlist was weeks long. So I called the closest place that I live by, and they didn\\'t pick up. I left my name and number along with the reason I called, but I just never got a call back. I then decided to call a place that one of my family members went to, and this time I was able to get my name down on their waitlist. But that\\'s the thing; the lady on the phone told me that I may have to wait 3-4 weeks before they match me with someone for my intake. I know that technically I have a place that I\\'ll be going to already, but I can\\'t help but feel so frustrated. I know I waited in the beginning, but now that I feel ready to talk to someone, it feels like no one\\'s ready to talk to me :/ It\\'s super discouraging, especially since things have been particularly hard for me lately...',\n",

But for the longest time, I would say the last 8 or 9 years, I have this existential dread always lingering. I feel like everyone’s life is more upward-sloping but mine has been in constant decline. \\n\\nI’m about to turn 20. I’m in college and miserable because I’m studying for a degree I am not interested in. I’m not interested in anything anymore really. I used to think I could be a writer or a painter or something in fashion and that was my calling, but every attempt at those things I just get so frustrated because I suck at it. I just can’t ever have a complete project to call my own and show everyone and be proud of it. I’m sitting on a bunch of half done art pieces, music loops not finished and a lot of clothes I bought to put my own designs on, sitting in my closet. I feel like I am to late to be great at something brand new. Now I find pleasure and happiness in nothing anymore. \\n\\nAs I get older I realize all the friends I have made recently are slowly dwindling away moving on in life. I can’t make those deep friendships anymore because I feel like no one I know actually wants to ever see or talk to me, even before this whole virus shit. The only way I get peoples attention is being funny. But being funny has really become a coping mechanism lately. When I was a lot younger, I would get super nervous around most people and resort to humor to break ice. Now i try to be funny all the time to make people like me, but now nobody really wants to get to know me beyond surface level bullshit that you would consider small talk. I can’t think of any of my friends who even know when my birthday is. I really feel alone.\\n\\nThen my family. They all really care about me, but any discussion about what I want to do with my life always turns ugly. Because I don’t know what I want anymore. I thought I did, but I can never motivate myself to do anything. I get surges of energy and then it’s gone for a long time. That’s how my life feels, waves of inspiration and the motivation to do something, then it’s gone. It always leaves so quickly. I think the worse thing is my parents never check on how I am mentally. They just complain that I don’t have a life goal like they do, and remind me that I need to figure shit out quick. I don’t think they have bad intentions, but I feel like my life priorities are so much different then theirs sometimes.\\n\\nNow here’s my biggest complaint. Every day, I feel like I am in a loop of bullshit. I eat, I work really hard to get As in school (this is the only reason my parents don’t just kick me out already because I am doing well in academics), then after I’ll once again pop an Adderall, waste time on some bullshit design or play around on FL and make some awful shit, get pissed and go to bed. That’s been my life the past couple years. I feel like I live two lives, one as a slave to bullshit I don’t care about at all, and me making an honest attempt at what I think I would love, and utterly failing. Both lives are reminders at how miserable I truly feel inside, and I go to bed feeling like that. I don’t really dream at all anymore, and I wake up so late for no reason.\\n\\nToday I really was at my end. I just kept thinking about how much of a failure I am, I sat on my second story windowsill and really thought about jumping. I think the biggest reason I never go through with self harm or suicide is because I know I haven’t done anything with my life yet, and I cling to the possibility that there is something for me. But every day it gets a little smaller, and it’s been shrinking for years.\\n\\nI think what really makes all of this shit bad is I don’t tell anyone about these thoughts or whatever it’s called. I hate thinking I’m depressed but I feel like I might be, despite what everyone thinks about me. I don’t know who to turn to anymore, to just sit down with someone and get everything off my chest. Because I really feel like anything I do or say to anyone, it just doesn’t matter. Nothing changes, I’m still stuck in this daily loop that I mentioned earlier. I feel very alone. At the same time I am scared of changes, and I don’t know why. I used to think I was special, that the things I would do or say matter, but as I get older I just realize how unspecial I truly am.

I almost started crying right there lol, but there were people around so i held it together. She even put her paw on me when I tried composing myself, almost broke down again. I just felt so loved? When she was licking my hands it reminded me of what I just did, it almost felt like she knew and was trying to cheer me up. I've never told anyone truly what was/is going on in my mind, cause I'm able to just cover it up with a smile. Eventually I started petting her and calmed down a little, thanking her over and over.

I’ve destroyed people families (sleeping with girlfriends and their mothers at the same time) I’ve alienated the majority of my relations with girls with emotional manipulation and just general horribleness, I’ve had (no joke) over 200 jobs in the last 2-3 years, I find it very difficult to connect with people and stay in contact with them, usually if I manage to do so it’s though a general love of narcotics, I’ve stolen things off friends that mean absolutely everything me (the friends I mean not the objects stolen) I have extreme anxiety and depression to the point that I just don’t interact with people and while I’m being honest 99% of the people in the world I fucking abhor. I’ve been accused of molesting a child when I was 14 (though I would never do anything like that, I may be completely fucking putrid as a human but I would never do such a thing) and basically I’m at the point where I’m ready to say goodbye.

This all started once I was told I would never be able to work again after becoming a mechanic when I was 17. 3 years ago I had a major surgery that was prolonged by the insurance company now I’m disabled with major arthritis in my lower back along with permanent nerve damage and my wife has fibromyalgia and is going through pain daily along with me. We also have 2 kids but I just feel like I’m failing my kids everyday. I was working on buying us a house before I broke my back in 2014. Once I stopped working all the money we had to use all of our savings to keep a roof over our heads and now we struggle more because my wife’s health is getting worse. She’s barely going to work and my disability isn’t enough for us to survive on. I’m seeing friends travel the world, signing off on getting their first homes, graduating school, and I’m just at home with nothing anymore. I lost my ambition to tattoo and draw after my surgery, my kids want to go out and play and I can barely walk around let alone take them out without being heavily medicated just to withstand the pain. I just don’t wanna live anymore some days...... I’m a failure and my family tries to tell me im not but it’s hard to believe them when I’m living around all of the hate and anger that has me in this state.......Im stuck in a horrible apartment in a horrible neighborhood where I can’t even take my kids to the local park without being approached by the local gang, or drug addicts! I just FUCKING HATE THIS PLACE, I HATE THIS PLACE, I HATE THIS PLACE! I try my best to keep optimism in play with us possibly getting a home but that shit is dead with the way our finances are! I’ll never be able to give my wife the home I promised her by 30, I’ll never be able to help my kids to where they will not have to struggle like they parents are doing, I’ll never be able to be successful like I wanted to be back when I graduated.......I’m not asking for a pity party I’m just frustrated, depressed and tired........

This guy asked me whether I pray or not and if I read Quran and I answered him honestly. I said I don't do any of these. And after a short moment, he ended the video call after telling that we should just call only. And so I called afterward, but no response. Nothing. \\n\\nAnd that brings me to here, reddit.

I currently make 60k/year +Bonuses (10-14%) and full benefits including 4 weeks paid vacation, Company vehicle/gas card, and I can set my own schedule/location. All on a 35hr/week basis working in upper management. Looking at all this I feel that I shouldn't have any reason to be unmotivated/unfulfilled in my life. Especially considering I only have a high school education and my coworkers all have degrees in business etc.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHowever lately I've had a hard time even getting out of bed none the less leaving my house to complete my work, I have no desire to see my friends or make new ones or meet a new spouse.

And what she has done to me has been the worst thing I\\'ve ever experienced in my life. Trying to find something to hold me together, to make the days pass, without trying to just either want to make it end, or just find a way to make the pain stop. I\\'m constantly checking her Facebook to see if she has any new post. Obsessing over something of hers, all of our memories in the house we built. I don\\'t know what to do. I\\'m lost. I have people to talk to, I have people who will listen to my story. I even have people who agree with everything I\\'ve done, saying you\\'ve done nothing wrong, she\\'s not willing to work on you on your marriage.\\n\\nAns so I sit at home, alone where the last 4 years of my life I spent with the woman who I thought I was going to die with. The woman who I thought was going to be the end-all-be-all in my life and in hers. Now she\\'s run off with someone 20 years older than her so that she can get her jollies off and adventure in her life. I f****** hate her I f****** hate what she did to me. I f****** hate the lives she\\'s ruined, not just mine, but of the friends that we shared. The only ones that even know our close friends that we shared together, and our families. No one outside of that mutual family knows anything. I want to scream out online that she cheated on me, that nobody should back her. that I wasn\\'t the one that shoved her away, that I wasn\\'t the one that made her not come home. I gave her every opportunity to try to help us bring us back together. Yes I had my faults. And I worked my damndest at fixing those before she left. But I wasn\\'t enough for her she said. I couldn\\'t keep up with her she said. I wasn\\'t intellectually smart as she said. I didn\\'t give her enough variety. I didn\\'t give her what she needed.\\n\\nI just don\\'t know what to do. I\\'ve not been alone like this in so long. Crying every night before I go to bed. Trying to just go to sleep and not have the voices in my head screaming at me. Trying not to think of what she\\'s doing right now with another guy. It tortures me to no end.',\n",

       " \"Everything I do is just a distraction. I'm essentially limited to three emotions now too: anxiety, anger, and sadness. If I'm not feeling those, I feel nothing. \\nIt makes me feel (ha) like a liar for saying I'm depressed because I can still function, but beyond doing what is absolutely necessary, I don't do anything at all. I just..do nothing. But even doing things that I 'like' it's as if I don't even like them anymore. I absolutely love the LotR movies, and I tried to watch one the other day and I just..couldn't. I turned it off and stared at a wall for awhile. \\n\\n\\nToday is a good example of what I mean. It was full of distractions. I was busy and had no time to think at all about anything other than what I was doing, and when I finally had a moment, my whole day came crashing. First, I felt anxious about not being 'depressed enough', and then stopped thinking about it because I ***do not*** want to think myself into a depressive state. Then, I thought about my day in general and realized that I didn't care about any of what I had done. Schoolwork? Check. Christmas bullshit for family? Check. Housework, pet's needs, even a workout so I don't get fat (because even when I do something good for myself, my motivation is anxiety and self hatred). But that's all I did, was check it off the list of Things Functioning People do. \\n\\nI don't even know if I'm depressed right now, it's just how I've always been hence the title. Every few months I'm the poster child for depression, but months like these are worse because I don't feel like a good person, I barely feel like a person at all. I attempted suicide (a long time ago; I'm fine now in that respect) during an episode like this once. My life is bullshit.\",\n",
       " \"I just want you guys to know I love you all. For the past couple years I've been in a downward spiral of depression. I got into a really bad accident which started it all off. Failed the first quarter of my nursing program which took over a year to get into then was placed at the bottom of the list again. This made me go even deeper into my depression. \\n\\nThis past year was filled with feelings of not wanting to exist. Contemplating the benefits my non-existence would have on others. Distancing myself from my amazing friends and family and most of all my husband. Causing extreme social anxiety for myself and feeling like a moron when speaking to others due to my isolation. Laying in bed, hiding from the world in the darkness of my covers. Starving because I just couldn't leave the safe haven of my bedroom. Feeling disgusting because I just couldn't muster up the energy to shower, brush my hair and teeth. Feeling like total shit and a waste of space because while I was wallowing in self pity, my amazing husband would go work his ass off to support us.  \\n\\nI just want to tell you all that I love you. Today has been a really good day. I slept like shit and woke up at 4 am after 4 hours of sleep and haven't taken a nap that would last late into the evening. I'm actually at the kitchen table. I'm here typing away while I listen to music and crying like a baby. God, I can't describe to you how much I love music and how stupid I am for pushing something I love so much out of my life. I haven't sat down and actually listened to music in so long and it just makes me so happy that I'm crying. I just feel so lucky in this moment. I hope it lasts. I hope I can hold on to this feeling and lock it up tight. I just love you guys so much and I wish I could share this with you. I wish I could spread this to you. Please, know you're not alone. Please, know that I will listen. Please, know that I love you. \\n\\nThanks for letting share my feelings. I'm so scared it won't last but I just want you guys to know there is something there.

       " \"I've had an okay life. I've had some unfortunate experiences with childhood sexual abuse and not being believed by my father, and I guess that sometimes I felt lonely and isolated, but overall, my life has not been terrible. I've always had enough to eat, I've been educated, I've been given the opportunity to travel, and I've felt loved.\\n\\nThe last year, though, was a nightmare. I started my masters in 2017 and was done with my work by the end of 2018. But I wasn't allowed to submit my dissertation until December 2019 because my supervisors delayed for the whole year. They were nightmares and constantly gaslit me by trying to make it seem like they were always there for support - we would meet once every 3 months and they wouldn't even listen to my progress. I had to beg them to even look at my work, which they would then submit (after barely browsing through it) and take credit for it. I ended up having a nervous breakdown some time in June where I just burst into tears and told them I have to finish by the end of the year. Anyways, so they continued to delay - I waited for the go ahead to submit my dissertation from my main supervisor, and found out two weeks and many unanswered emails later that he had taken a holiday and didn't bother to email me the permissions beforehand (he had ample time to do so).\\n\\nAnyways... So I finally finished...\\nAnd now, I'm just... Wow.\\nSo because I finished so late, I have to wait until June to be placed into a job by the graduate program. So I have to spend the next six months doing nothing. Also, I spent the last three years shunning all of my friends because I was so focused on my research and where has that landed me? Alone, miserable and unable to talk to anyone about anything other than work.\\n\\nI feel like a burden on my parents (I'm 24), I am constantly depressed, and the thought of getting up every morning just drains me. My mum tells me to just relax, she thinks that after everything from the last year, I need a few months to take a break - but how can I? I'm too old for this, I should have my shit together. What if I never get my shit together?\\nMy therapist told me it's most likely that I'm experiencing PTSD symptoms from having to deal with all the frustration from the last year and I guess that's true. I'm snappy and irritable, and I'm just so tired. I cry at the idea of continuing in my chosen field because the last year made me hate it so much. But it's too late and doesn't make financial sense for me to start over.\\n\\nSo I'm stuck. I know it's probably just until June, but I feel like a failure. Those of my friends who chose to not do their masters have jobs and are climbing the career ladder, and I'm sitting at home festering in anger and sadness. I don't want to be envious or jealous but it's like those feelings consume me. I want to move my career overseas and just feel like this is delaying me. I feel like I made the wrong choices all the time. \\nI know other people have it worse than me, but I just feel so scared and tired and broken all the time. It's like, even now, I feel as if there's a literal crack in my chest that causes me pain and makes it harder and harder to breathe. Sometimes I don't sleep, sometimes I oversleep. I'm so angry all of the time and I don't want to be - not towards those I love, at least. I am just such a failure, and I keep burdening them and hurting them too.\\n\\nI don't know a way forward. I don't know if I want a way forward. I just feel unprotected and unprepared and like a complete failure.\\n\\nEdit: **I do not consent to my story being shared by anyone in any form on any platform**\"]"
