At a time when I was finding it hard to see the bigger picture because I was stuck in the black hole of depression, I took this incredibly seriously and it made my condition much worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t receive the help I deserved at work, until I eventually, after months of comments on my mental health, I made a formal complaint of harassment and bullying. Had my boss, and my workplace, had training into supporting someone with a mental health problem, I might still be there.\n",

      "I finally got the help I needed to help me move on from the experience, and I developed the tools I needed to manage my condition at work. I’d be deluded if I said the depression was gone. It hasn’t and there are days when I feel the dark cloud coming over me, and I feel suffocated by my own thoughts. But I’ve learned to accept them, and deal with each day as it comes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can now look back on my negative experience at work as a learning. It forced me to grow up and accept my condition rather than fear it, and to take the confidence in knowing what was best for me and standing up for myself and what support I needed.  In coming out of the hardest year of my life, and through my mental health diagnosis, I have learnt what true resilience is. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wish my work had been given the support they needed to support me. Both me and my boss gave up our careers at an incredible job because neither of us knew how to cope at the time. Education and training are key. We all deserve to feel safe at work.\n",
      "\n",

      "A recent survey of the charity sector uncovered some uneasy reading about bullying and mental health at work. Whilst this made me realise I’m not alone, it also made me realise just how important it is to speak openly about mental health and how we are feeling. We must all continue to call out the injustices people with mental health conditions face at work if we are to make real change for future generations. \n",

      "\n",
      "We’ve a long way to go. But there is hope. I didn’t feel it then, but I certainly feel it now. It really is time to change\n",
      "I've been suffering from depression for just under four years, and depression has a way of replacing your confidence with pure anxiety and self-hatred. \n",
      "\n",
      "The scariest thing I found about suffering from a mental illness is the effect it has on every aspect of your life; it’s not just what’s inside your head. For me, suffering from depression became debilitating as I couldn't find happiness in the little things I used to enjoy doing. More often than not, depression would cause me to sit in my room and cry, usually for no reason at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was told a lot that 'I had nothing to be depressed about' and that 'I’ll get over it’ because I have a great group of friends and no enemies to worry about, but the real enemy I had made was with myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression is something that cannot be healed simply, and I wish I had been told just how easy it can be to fall back into a spiral of severe isolation and anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's so typical to believe that depression is nothing more than being sad. Depression isn’t feeling sad; if it were, it would be so much easier to deal with. Every time I'd let depression affect me, my body would go into shut down as I'd hardly sleep, I'd be sick: I had no energy to fight how I felt. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’d be asked what triggered me to feel ‘sad’, and I felt so humiliated that I didn’t have a ‘trigger’; depression hits you when you least expect it, and it comes in frequent waves. As well as being physically fatigued, my depression led to paranoia, which had a huge impact on my life, causing me to fret and become severely overwhelmed, and so, the cycle continued between being paranoid, which made me panic, which made me depressed. I wish I had been told that depression isn't something to be ashamed of, as telling people I had depression was a task I still struggle to achieve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sadly, I’ve found that depression (as well as other mental illnesses) are romanticized, especially in the media. There really isn’t anything glamorous about suffering from depression, and it’s important that this trend is stopped before it gets out of hand. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s so true when you hear that support is always available, whether it be from friends, families, charities or organisations, but seeking this kind of support made me feel uncomfortable at first. Depression isolates you, making you believe your importance matters less than those around you. Depression pushed so many people out of my life to the point where I feared forming friendships, because the pain of losing the people I loved was too much to bear.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was important that my friends would embrace my depression rather than see it as a flaw of mine, so I began openly talking about it to those around me, and by raising awareness, quite a few of my friends stepped forward to say they had been through the same, or at least knew somebody who did. \n",
      "\n",
      "By accepting my depression and openly discussing it with others, I didn't feel as ashamed anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realised for the first time that I wasn’t alone, and mental illness is actually far more common than we’re led to believe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mental illness isn’t a trend, but it shouldn’t be a taboo either. One day, we’ll find the middle ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been two years since my very first dealing with depression and anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember the day when I first hit a low point in life and it's not a nice memory to have. I didn't know how to deal with such a strong mental health issue, so I hid my problems away from family and friends which made my issues worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't want to get out of bed, I didn't want to socialise with friends and I’d put off family days out. There came a time when I questioned my existence in life; was I a burden? Was I even worth having around? What did I bring to life in general?\n",
      "\n",
      "One day everything just got too much, and I sadly and now regrettably tried to take my own life, not once but twice. It was at this point when I knew I needed professional help and I needed to speak out, which started my recovery to this day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I received help and support from a lot more people than I ever expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Men are usually surrounded by toxic masculine stereotypes, e.g always being told to ' man up ' which shouldn't be the case - and this is why men find it so hard to open up about their problems whether it be mental health, illnesses, financial problems or addictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "I personally haven't experienced anybody telling me to 'man up' or 'grow some balls' - fortunately I've been brought up around family and friends who have always told me the best way to get through your troubles is to openly speak out, whether that be to a professional or to a family member or friend. Nobody should be made to feel alone and closed in, especially if they're going through changes in life or mental struggles.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took it upon myself to talk on BBC Humberside radio about my experience and started to work closely with smaller organisations to help beat the stigma surrounding mental health towards men. \n",
      "\n",
      "Choosing to openly speak out isn't for everybody and certainly isn't easy. It does take a lot of courage and confidence which I had to build back up from scratch. \n",
      "\n",
      "After many toxic past relationships which didn't help in my favour for my mental illness, I am now in a happy place - not just with a beautiful woman who I idolise and worship, but most importantly with myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that with determination comes willpower, and with willpower comes the road to recovery. I do still suffer from mild depression and anxiety so I'm not quite there yet myself. It’s still a battle I’m fighting, but I have so much more fight in me than I used to have 2 years ago. My anxiety still makes me feel like I may lose what’s important to me and that I'll mess up in some way or another, when in hindsight everything in life is going well so far. It's something I need to overcome, and something I know I will conquer within time. \n",
      "\n",
      "A little message to those who have read this today (and I thank you if you have): \n",
      "\n",
      "When you're feeling low, try and remember you're loved and cared for more than you think. You're doing great even if you feel otherwise - you're doing a brilliant job and things don't just get better with a click of your fingers (although I wish they did). When the time is right, you know when you'll be ready to speak out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I work in a large factory, so I meet a lot of people with very different attitudes and opinions about mental health. I was diagnosed with severe depression just over 8 years ago. At that time I had a few months off work, had counselling and went on to medication. My employers were good and understanding. But the people I work with are a different matter. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t advertise that I have depression but I make no secret of it. If someone wants to talk to me about it, I will talk. And a few people have genuinely been interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve had a few bad episodes where I needed some time off. I’ve tried to keep these to a minimum but sometimes just getting out of bed is all I can manage. All my efforts are spent fighting off the suicidal thoughts and just coping through the days.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a good working relationship with my manager and she was very supportive. It was during one of these episodes that the conversation happened. My manager was telling two of the crew members, who knew about my mental health issue, that I wouldn’t be in for a while. The two guys had always seemed to empathise with me. One of them, who had been in hospital years earlier because of a mental breakdown and depression, asked my manager: what use was I to anyone if I was going keep having time off?\n",
      "\n",
      "My manager defended me, and told them: if I was fighting a physical illness, they wouldn’t be saying that.\n",
      "\n",
      "A factory is a place where everything gets around - and when I got back to work I heard about it. Knowing that a factory is also a hive of gossip too I chose not to believe it, putting it down to rumours. But it ate away at me every time I saw them. \n",
      "\n",
      "I challenged my manager about it, and to my surprise, she confirmed that they had said it. Since that day I have been very wary about the false empathy and empty gestures that people throw out. It has made me very jaded and even more guarded than I was previously. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s hard to know when people are genuine, so I now try not to discuss mental health with anyone. A very backward step for me but stigma and attitude, I believe haven’t changed. People are often just learning the right phrases to say, paying lip service to the buzz words of the moment. Where I think things have moved forward is that people that have these illnesses of the mind are coming together and supporting each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the crew members that said these things has a son who is now suffering from depression. He comes to me for advice on what his son should do. I inwardly hate this person and their ignorance but wear the “I’m ok” mask every day. I wouldn’t wish this illness on my worst enemy so I genuinely help the best I can. \n",
      "\n",
      "In my experience people don’t learn about mental illness until it hits them square between the eyes and they are forced to.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a negative, you never know what tomorrow will bring - on a positive, you never what tomorrow will bring. Stay strong.\n",
      "I was first diagnosed as having depression in 2004 following the death of my father, nothing overly surprising there. In time, my mental health improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had some ‘ups’ and ‘downs’ over the next few years, but I was relatively stable. Until, that is, my second son was born. Looking back now, it’s quite easy to recognise that I was suffering from Post Natal Depression (PND), but at the time I never considered it could be a possibility. I felt a panic build inside me, and afterwards I just found it difficult to bond with him. My wife at the time was breastfeeding and so I was left out, and whenever I asked if I could do anything to help, I was usually met with sarcastic comments.  Things got worse as time went on, and my inability to develop that bond, made it seem to her that I wasn’t trying to help out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I failed to understand what was going on. I was struggling with low mood, short term memory loss, and general lethargy and lack of motivation – but she saw me as being lazy and awkward.\n",
      "\n",
      "It built to a head. My wife found me in tears and when she asked me what was wrong, I told her that I had figured out that her and the boys would be better off without me. Her response… “Don’t be so stupid!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at this time I went to our GP and was put back onto anti-depressants for the first time since my dad had died.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told my boss what was going on at home, and he put me onto the company Employee Assistance Program, and I started receiving counselling.  My wife took offense to this.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would just have been nice to have a “How are you getting on?” or “Are you okay?” but I felt very isolated and alone, unable to talk to anyone for fear of getting the same reaction from others.  I was definitely made to feel “less than a man” by her and it was most certainly a concern that I would be viewed as weak by others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, this led to our marriage breaking down and I had to move out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve spent the last 7 years essentially hiding from everyone – and most importantly, from myself – that I was still suffering from depression. This has affected my physical health too, and I now have IBS and migraines associated with anxiety and depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve had a great deal of time off work sick, and nearly lost my job because of it. But it was the thing that gave me the kick I needed to admit what was going.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can honestly say it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do – admit I need help!\n",
      "\n",
      "As it transpired, when I finally opened up, I was surprised by the number of people who then turned around and said “I know what you mean. I went through something, some years back…”  That and finding out people I know quite well, who have also been diagnosed with depression, that I had no idea about either.  I still feel a bit “odd” talking so openly about it now, but it is getting easier and less uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m now involved in a study of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and I’m starting to get the help I so badly needed. Unfortunately, having waited so long, I’ve got 10-years worth of depression and anxiety to overcome. It’s become part of my normal day-to-day routine to lie about how I’m feeling and hide it from everyone, a cycle I’m finding hard to break.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I had asked for help much, much sooner. But that said, there was much more stigma around mental health 10 years ago and were I to have said something, would I have gotten the help I’m receiving now…? Who knows! But the fact that there are organisations like Time to Change around has made things easier for those of us who are suffering and need help, to step forward and ask.\n",
      "I’ve always been open about my mental illness in most areas of my life, but until last year I’d never spoken about it at work. I was concerned that if I told colleagues I struggle with general anxiety disorder and depression, it would hamper my progression and I wouldn’t be taken seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was diagnosed a few years ago, and there have only been a few periods where my mental illness has affected my capacity to work. Last summer, my responsibilities increased dramatically in a short space of time, creating a lot of anxiety. It began to affect my mood at home; I was irritable, unable to relax and constantly low, which was a big warning sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I decided to say something. Talking about my mental health with my loved ones has always made things so much easier, and I realised that I needed the same at work. During a one to one with my line manager I ended up explaining my mental illness and the struggles I have. Her reaction was incredible. She thanked me for being honest, assured me I’d have the support I needed and even spoke about her own mental health. It felt so good to have opened up in such a huge area of my life, and my manager’s warmth and compassion dissolved any worries I’d had about being judged.\n",
      "\n",
      "This went a long way to helping when my mental health took a turn for the worse just before Christmas. I started struggling badly with insomnia - something I’ve dealt with before due to childhood trauma. It made me extremely anxious and depressed. I felt ashamed, but also petrified that I’d never be able to sleep properly again, and that this would completely erode my sanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The festive period gave us a week and a half off from work and things seemed to improve; I was sleeping well and my mental health was evening out again as I got used to the course of antidepressants I’d recently started.\n",
      "\n",
      "My problems returned as soon as I went back to work in early January. I couldn’t sleep and the anxiety and depression swept back in. Suicidal thoughts flew into my mind. I went into the office as much as I could, but my mind was consumed by fear and panic all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "My manager sat me down and told me to have a serious think about taking a few weeks off work. I was worried that it might do more harm than good, so took a few days to think about it. Both my manager and her line manager gave me all the information I needed and went out of their way to assure me that it wouldn’t cause problems for the rest of my team.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I told them that my GP had signed me off for two weeks, they were incredibly supportive. In fact, they essentially ordered me to not think about work at all while I was away - they wanted me to completely focus on getting better. This lifted a huge weight off my shoulders and allowed me the time and space to properly recover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I started my break, several colleagues sent me messages of support and let me know they were there to talk. Depression can make you feel completely alone, but knowing that people have your back is so empowering.\n",
      "\n",
      "My two weeks off ended up being extended to a full month, and in that time my colleagues sent me a card and regularly checked in to see how I was doing. To know I was in their thoughts made me feel worthwhile again and saved me from feeling cut off. It also helped me return to work; there weren’t worries about how people would react. I knew they supported me, and it was liberating to have them know what I was going through.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a phased return, but what also helped was how my manager and colleagues pulled together to support me once I was back. I was allowed to take things at my own pace, and no one made me feel inferior. In fact, they all treated me just as they had before I took time off. I wasn’t seen as a special case, or broken in anyway, which helps to normalise things. It also meant that when someone at work asks how I’m doing, I don’t just have to say ‘OK, thanks.’ I now know that if I’m having trouble, I can be honest about it, and that is a huge help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being open about my mental health at work has been a vital part of my recovery, and to have such a compassionate reaction from my friends in the office made things so much easier.\n",
      "It’s hard to tell if a person is depressed unless they break down in front of you or manage to tell you themselves. Depression doesn’t leave scars, not always. And it’s hard to say how bad it is if you can’t see the wound.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you know someone who’s going through a difficult time, if you have even the slightest doubt, reach out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you think it wouldn’t help, do it. Even if you think bringing it up could make it worse, or that it wouldn’t make a difference at all, even if it makes you uncomfortable, do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They don’t need much from you.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, understand that their state of mind, the place they’re in, is on a different dimension. Depression is not just an extreme version of the sadness that you know, it’s sadness on a whole other dimension, one that is comparable and yet is entirely different, so different you can’t even begin to imagine it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let me tell you what you can’t see. You can’t see they’re numb inside when they laugh at your jokes, that they haven’t eaten in three days, that they wish they won’t wake up when they go to bed every night.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important that you do see it, that you at least show that you want to. Because that person needs you. They need someone, anyone, to tell them it’ll get better. They might get through it alone, they’re strong, no doubt. They’ll talk themselves out of harming themselves, cry themselves to sleep, drag themselves to get help, and convince themselves to keep going another day. And they just might. But maybe they won’t. The illness bends their mind, tells them to stop fighting, and convinces them there’s nothing left to fight for.\n",
      "\n",
      "In those times, they will need you to say that it’s all a lie. That they deserve to see the other side of the darkness, and that you will sit by them till they no longer need to fight. That the little hope they have is real. That their dark thoughts are nothing more than chemical imbalances – it’s not them, just a temporary tarp covering their light, that a beautiful life is waiting for them at the other end, waiting for them to get through some more time. That it’ll be worth it. Say it over and over again. Till they believe it. And then say it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don’t know what to do, ask them. Even a “You okay?” means a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "It could make me take a break from crying into a pillow to watch Netflix for a bit. It could slow down an escalating bad day, make me feel just a little less lost, enough to get through the rest of the day. Ask them if they ate anything all day. You don’t need to come up with some speech. You don’t need to say anything at all – sit next to them. Hold their hand while they try not to break down.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for those who are going through any version of a difficult time right now, or ever have, know that you deserve such support, and you might already have it. You might even have the best possible people in your life and still not have quite the support you need. That’s perfectly normal. It’s not that you don’t deserve it, or they don’t care enough, they just don’t really know what you need. It’s sad and unfair, I know. But that’s okay. Take all the help you can get. Or ask for it. I swear they’ll want to.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’re capable of getting through this. But you don’t have to do it alone.\n",
      "I saw a lot of employers posting about Mental Health Awareness Week. It is absolutely crucial we start conversations about the realities of mental illness and it’s great that it’s happening, but I wish some employers would stop kidding themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve worked all my adult life, before, during and since my diagnosis and treatment. I was diagnosed with moderately severe depression and anxiety and bulimia in 2007. I've had CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy), and am currently seeing a private therapist weekly. I never got so much as a displeased look… until I disclosed my mental health problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have disclosed twice in corporate environments. Both times my employment became a cycle of letters requesting meetings asking why I was sick? Why did I get the flu so easily? My situation isn’t new. Since sharing my story, I’ve encountered many separate accounts detailing variations on my own experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve found employment nothing but a minefield of misunderstandings and complete unwillingness, (despite the initial platitudes), to actually accept and support employees with a mental illness. And now suddenly all these employers are declaring their “awareness” on every social media platform available to them; welcoming us into the workplace. As if they’ve always been there and I’m just too afraid to ask. Not that I can speak for anyone else, but there’s a reason I’ve become reticent, and it’s not fear of judgement; it’s experience of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It isn’t just about talking. Support is an ever-evolving process; the process of accepting who we are, without judgement and acting accordingly - and that isn’t limited to what your own idea of “equality” dictates. “Awareness” is something you can get from our application form. In my experience, this is where it gets uncomfortable for employers. They have all these policies for “work/life balance,” and still create an environment so pressured it becomes impossible to complete your workload without working through lunch. Let on that you’re struggling, by all means, but prepare to be asked the question: “is this a legitimate concern or is it just a symptom of your condition?” That’s a quote from an ex employer. The only conclusion I could draw from it at the time was “you have anxiety, so your concerns aren’t real.” This, in turn, caused more anxiety. I can’t think why.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s another one:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know promoting mental health is your thing but be careful who you share your story with because some people might not understand.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "This nugget of wisdom was imparted to me by a manager in a work setting with, I think overall, good - if fatally misguided - intentions. Implicit in their words was a very serious underlying problem: acceptance of potential discrimination as part of the infrastructure of the place of employment without open acknowledgement of its injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      " As I re-read this passage, I’m a bit indignant. Just try replacing “mental health” with any other condition and see how that sentence comes out:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know dyslexia is your thing but could you just try not to struggle with words in front of people?”\n",
      "“I know autism is your thing but…”\n",
      "“I know cancer is your thing but…”\n",
      "\n",
      "I have remembered that sentence - that sentence and many others from people with more \"professional\" power than myself, who \"can't understand why a counsellor would advise\" this that or the other; who ask of my occupational health record: \"is it really relevant to the case?\" having not read it before calling me into a meeting to discuss whether to take punitive action over a flu virus: - (In this instance, it was particularly relevant as I was a recovering bulimic at the time with a compromised immune system).\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been asked, (by a manager), \"how does your boyfriend deal with this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1. It's not relevant \n",
      "2. Why am I something to be “dealt with?” I’m not a slug that turned up in your bathroom!\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer, (not that I am obliged to share it), is unabashedly - \"he makes me a cup of tea and we get on with it.\"  Their surprise at my answer denotes another significant lack of understanding and/or willingness to accept that what is being said is normal. There’s that word again: Accept. \n",
      "\n",
      "Allowing me the luxury of disclosure is not acceptance. Acceptance is not saying \"it's OK if you leave early for a counselling appointment.\" That is a reasonable adjustment. Reasonable adjustment is the law. You're not doing us a favour by observing our human right to exist and be ill. \n",
      "\n",
      "Acceptance is going beyond the law and taking us out of the box we ticked. It's remembering we are human - more so than your average - and yes being uber-human is frightening because it magnifies the onlooker's vulnerability. We get it's scary to look at us being scared.\n",
      "\n",
      "We cannot change the condition. Fact. So it's on you. You've posted your posts, you've tweeted your tweets. Congratulations. You're aware.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now what are you going to do with it?\n",
      "A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD). When the symptoms and potential causes were described to me it made a lot of sense and in hindsight this is something that has followed me since my childhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "An unwillingness to seek help due to fear and shame meant I wasn’t diagnosed until I had turned 30, had a few failed suicide attempts under my belt and a history of self-harm and eating disorders.\n",
      " \n",
      "It took me a while to come to terms with my diagnosis and I continued to keep it secret for a pretty long time. I’d had a lifetime of keeping my issues a secret and it hadn’t got me anywhere. But by opening up to medical professionals I was finally getting some support.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I decided to try to be more open with other people in my life. But it’s hard opening up; it takes guts to tell someone about the thing you hate most about yourself – so their reaction means everything! At its best opening up can leave you feeling empowered, heard and hopeful, but at its worst it causes real damage. \n",
      "\n",
      "I try not to focus on the bad experiences, but it’s a struggle not to. When I hit a rough patch a while back and needed some support from a previous employer I had an experience that really scarred me. \n",
      " \n",
      "I was in the midst of a prolonged period of depression and my anxiety levels were sky high. I spoke to my manager about it as I was getting increasingly worried about my low mood and ability to balance my workload. When my anxiety is at its worst I struggle to make even the simplest of decisions, I agonise over every possible option and outcome and it can make being productive at work impossible. \n",
      " \n",
      "When I told my manager that I was struggling with depression and anxiety their first response was to make a joke about it: “well, we’d better get you carted off to the loony bin then”. At least I think this was an attempt at a joke, if it was it didn’t land!\n",
      " \n",
      "This crushed me. I felt stupid and ashamed, but perhaps worst of all I felt like I couldn’t rely on my workplace for support when I needed it. There were countless other occasions where my manager made jokes about my mental health, both when it was just the two of us and in front of my colleagues. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I requested to work from home on days that I didn’t feel well enough to commute and be surrounded by people all day - but I felt able to work – I was told no, I’d have to take sick days instead.\n",
      " \n",
      "So, I kept working, I kept ignoring my body and mind when it was on the verge of spiralling, until eventually I ended up at rock bottom. I couldn’t leave my bed, let alone my house. I was consumed with impulsive and harmful thoughts about hurting myself or ending my life. I was signed off from work for six weeks, had a few emergency trips to hospital and was put under the care of my community mental health team.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came back to work (because I wouldn’t get sick pay if I was off any longer) I was immediately given a formal disciplinary for being off sick, despite having a letter from my GP.\n",
      " \n",
      "Shortly after returning to work a new manager started. I thought things might get better, but they became worse. My new manager had a similar approach to dealing with people with mental health problems as the last one. They made jokes and mean remarks, and at one point I was taken aside and told “I heard rumours you’re a self-harmer and tried to kill yourself, if that’s true you need to tell me”. \n",
      " \n",
      "At the time I was a manager myself, and I still am, and I can’t understand how so many managers could have such a poor understanding of mental health and lack even the ability to treat someone with compassion and understanding. I’m hoping I was just unlucky and that others aren’t getting the same treatment when they tell their employer about their mental health problems, but I imagine I’m not alone.\n",
      " \n",
      "I have since moved roles and now work somewhere that I can be open about my mental health, work flexible hours so I can make my therapy appointments and take some space when I need it. The best thing is feeling able to talk frankly about how I am feeling without the fear of being stigmatised. Being open is still a work in progress but every day it gets a little easier.\n",
      " \n",
      "Before I left, I recommended that my employer provide some training for managers on how to manage people who have a mental illness, or just how to compassionately support people when they are having a hard time! I also referred them to the resources on the Time to Change website – I’d like to think that they used this but who knows.\n",
      "Two years ago, I started to experience mental health difficulties for the first time. What I mean by that is, two years ago I first became conscious of my own mental illness. My close friends will tell you that this all started long before two years ago. They are probably right but my own awareness only began when I was forced to retire from sport with injury in June 2017, aged 20.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sport was a massive part of my life. It gave me my edge, a place to release my competitiveness, my aggression and my energy in a healthy way. To lose that before I hit my peak broke me. After finishing playing, I started to feel different almost immediately - less in control of my mood and my energy. I was due to go travelling with friends soon after and I used that as my suppression tool. I thought that partying and travelling would bring me back to myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was sure all I needed was something to take my mind off things. Instead, the travelling, drinking and partying made things worse. Panic attacks and anxiety fits took over from fun and excitement. I’m a confident person, I’ve always been successful in academics, sport, my career, but that all felt very far away. Within weeks, I’d gone from an unstoppable person who could achieve anything, to someone who was scared to face the world. Suddenly, anxiety and depression surrounded my every waking moment. All I wanted to do was go home, I wasn’t me. I would wake up scared about having an anxiety attack, tension headache or down day. Sleep was the only relief, which as part of a despairing irony, became harder to come by as the condition continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to counselling when I returned from my holiday. I thought, “I’ll go for 3-4 sessions and I’ll be good as new, it was just that I was away from home and a bit shook”. I went in hoping for a magic cure for my anxiety and depression, but I quickly realised that this doesn’t exist. Over time it became apparent that this was more serious than I first thought. Over-exercising had allowed me to push down my issues and losing sport was not only a grief in itself but it also meant that I wasn't able to forget anymore, I had to deal with my demons. \n",
      "\n",
      "I found it very difficult to accept what was happening to me. I was used to being numb to my emotions or at least not letting them get in my way. Now I was dealing with the idea of carrying this label of anxiety and depression everywhere I went. I felt overwhelmed, weak, powerless.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first told my dad about my anxiety, he said “What are you anxious about?”, and when I first informed him of my depression a few weeks later he said “I can accept the anxiety but I don’t think you’re depressed son”. It is a difficult enough journey of self-acceptance as it is, never mind feeling judged or unsupported by family or friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of my friends and family were great - my Mam is a counsellor and my girlfriend is a nurse. They understood what was going on and they talked to me with compassion. They helped me normalise how I was feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "To anyone who knows someone struggling with mental illness, don’t let them feel like they are “crazy” or that what they are experiencing isn’t normal. Having someone to speak to without judgement helped me feel safe and like I could actually manage. With their support I decided to challenge my dad to learn more about what was going on with me. I sent him videos, articles and books. Over time he began to accept my journey. He was scared his son might be “broken” and that he let that happen. Sometimes older generations label mental illness as being “broken”. That isn’t even close to the truth. In fact it has been the catalyst for me to open up about my struggles, to share the load and build closer bonds with my parents, friends and girlfriend. Sometimes it takes that.\n",
      "\n",
      "My illness has encouraged me to analyse my life. Anxiety and depression have been a wakeup call. My lifestyle was burning me out. I worked myself too hard. Whenever I wasn’t working or studying, I was socialising or playing sport. I left no time to check in with myself or to talk to people about issues in my life. I created an environment for myself where personal issues could be hidden behind walls of work and activities. If I didn’t have to think about issues, did they even exist? If they didn’t exist, what was there to talk about?\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s tough to change that thought pattern. We live in a world where working ludicrously long hours means we are “committed” or a “hard worker”. These are things that employers, teachers, parents and peers all praise. My family instilled an unhealthy work ethic in me, one that would earn me huge success and plaudits in school, sport and career, but one that burnt me out to the point of collapse. Being busy is rarely called out as a negative. It wasn’t until I went to counselling that I was questioned as to why I do so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I’m trying to push loving myself to the top of my agenda. It’s difficult because for 90% of my life I’ve hidden from allowing myself to feel exactly what has been going on with my mental state. Be it my parent’s separation, my forced retirement from sport, heartbreaks or deaths, I suppressed it all and used activity as my therapy. Sitting with it is a lot scarier but I’m starting to feel the benefit, I’m starting to heal.\n",
      "\n",
      "All I can say to people going through something similar is - this is scary, there is no denying that. If you can love yourself and completely experience your mental illness then you’ll be OK. Just hang in there.\n",
      "Ah depression and anxiety, my two controversial friends that have placed me in a non-consensual three-way relationship which is often very difficult to deal with. I can wake up some days and feel like I’m ready to take on anything. But on one side of the bed, I’ll have my anxiety badgering me about the million and one things that will go wrong today. And on the other side of the bed, my depression will remind me about the social event that I’ll be taking part in later that evening and casually reminding me that no matter how confident I’ll appear to be, that the people I think that love me in fact don’t, they’d rather I not be there, and that I’m weak and eventually push everyone I love away from me. And then I get up and get on with my day, after crying on my pillow, and admitting defeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some would call me over-emotional. Some will tell me, and have told me before, to simply move past my problems and carry on. Some people just don’t understand how you can’t just put the thing that’s worrying you, or dragging you down, in the bin and never look back. Sometimes I am able to do this, and I feel better. But when I can’t, please understand that it’s not that I don’t want to feel happy or stop my brain racing. Believe me, if I could do it all the time, I would. But I am constantly battling my anxiety and depression, and sometimes they win, and it can be hard to control. Imagine playing your favourite video game and you have the controller, but sometimes, the controls will bug out, not work like they should, and it starts ruining your game. That is what my anxiety and depression feel like to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t blame people that don’t understand my anxiety and depression, I really don’t. From an outsider looking in, it may just look like I’m over-reacting, that I’m dramatic and attention seeking. I’m very aware of what it may look like, but I promise it is not that. I take antidepressants to help keep my anxiety and depression on the low-down, but that doesn’t mean that I am ‘cured’. It also doesn’t mean that I am sick, or that I can’t be like anyone else, do things that everyone else can and live a relatively normal life. Because I can. I just occasionally put my training wheels back on when I feel like I need them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t need you to tell me to ‘stop worrying’ because I will always worry, even if my face and body language says otherwise. I sometimes need that reassurance that everything is ok, that I am loved, and that you won’t leave me when I need you the most, even if in the depths of my brain, my depression is telling me it’s not true. But I also don’t need you to be afraid of me, because underneath the dark cloud that my anxiety and depression form, there’s a normal human being who wants to be loved, is kind, understanding, has a sense of humour (or so I’d like to think) and always tries to put a smile on her face and on other people’s, even if it feels like I’m losing my battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today has been a day where my anxiety and depression defeated me but writing this is my way of taking back control. It is temporary, and I have accepted that, but I’ll bounce back because I always do.\n",
      "I had never heard of the word anxiety. I had heard of depression but didn’t understand it, and at that point, I never thought it would hit me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2012 I graduated with a 2:1 degree, made amazing friends and I was working for a company I loved. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out where I was working and I decided to leave my job and search for another one. It was a hard decision walking away from the company I loved but I knew I had my education and experience on my side.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February 2013 I attended a football match, I was the biggest football fan in the world! I watched games from all different leagues regardless of who was playing, but visiting this particular stadium was a big part of my life, it was like a dream. What I didn’t realise was I was gaining anxiety. I was sat in high seats and had an overwhelming feeling, I had no idea what this was - all I knew was that I felt light-headed continuously, which lead to me experiencing my first ’fight-or-flight’ sensation. I ran to the closest tube station and went home confused and emotional.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does depression look like?\n",
      "After this episode, things just got worse. I didn’t leave the house, I constantly felt paranoid and emotional, my confidence had completely gone. I become completely unsociable. I was unemployed and applying for at least 10 jobs a day doing anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took someone close to me to see the signs of depression. My idea of depression was an older person who had lost everything, not someone who’s just graduated from university with their whole life ahead of them. This goes to show mental health can impact anyone at any age, at any stage of their life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was lucky - I gained medical help and eventually got a local job at the same time. The hardest thing I had to do was tell my new boss I had a mental health issue. There's a lot of negative stigma surrounding mental health, especially in the Asian community, but I was lucky I had an understanding manager and team who helped me gain my confidence back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I eventually went back to work in the career I loved but I still wasn’t myself. I was quiet, I had no confidence and had to do ‘rituals’ to get me through the day. For example, I would sit and do exercises from my desk to keep my mind occupied and anxiety down.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where I believe understanding of mental health in the workplace is severely lacking. Looking back, it also shows how untrained my manager was; advising a colleague ‘try to make her more talkative’ was the wrong approach. Hopefully, in time there will be a movement towards ‘we have a new starter who isn’t settling in too well, let me see how she’s adapting to change’, and more understanding about anxiety and depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opening up about my mental health\n",
      "Luckily, I met someone who I was able to open up to, and this was the real start of my recovery. I felt comfortable confiding in what I had been through and how I felt. Instead of thinking, “I’m taking a risk and being judged”, I felt I could comfortably be myself again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conversations didn’t feel difficult; it felt like a genuine conversation where I could talk about my stress and anxieties. I gained my confidence back and become sociable. Importantly, I become happy again, and I started travelling which I would never have done without having someone to confide my fears in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest achievement was going back to passion, my football. Never did I think I would ever attend a football match again in my life - and here I was sitting among 90,000 people at Wembley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking a different approach\n",
      "I thought my anxiety and depression were beyond me…but they came back. The difference this time was that I knew what anxiety and depression were, I knew what was going to happen, but most importantly I knew I wanted to fight this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did slip down a bad path and my behaviours and actions were not me at all. However, I was open and honest to my friend who helped me through before, and it helped me realise I had motives to continue and get back to being myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is when I decided to become a mental health first aider. Since I've been open about my mental health difficulties, people have been able to open up to me in the same way I was able to open up to my friend. For that reason, all the training I have done has been worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe we still have a long way to go for society to understand how to deal with mental health, but there is positive movement towards better mental health awareness.\n",
      "Leading up to the day I opened up about my mental health I had struggled with anxiety for many years. It affected me in many ways and eventually opened the door for depression to come in, which would then take hold of my life for over a year. Throughout that time trying to deal with my anxiety and depression brought with it a lot of negative habits. The build-up of these bad habits would eventually get me to the point where the thought of doing something I used to enjoy would set off negative feelings about myself and my life. Now because this would repeatedly happen, I became too scared to even try and be happy for such a long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lost all interest in the hobbies I would have enjoyed in the past. And this was because of that internal tug of war that I was having to go through every day. On one side I would know that I had stopped doing what I enjoyed, and it would make me feel so ashamed and angry that I was letting this get the better of me. But on the other end, if I did try to push myself to something, it would be met with immediate anxiety because I knew those feelings of guilt would soon follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either way, I couldn’t win so I would be losing days and weeks due to this internal battle and by the time this had been going on for so long, I had eventually convinced myself that I didn’t deserve to be happy anymore. If I wasn’t at work, I would just spend my time stuck in this tug of war. Never giving myself the time to relax and feel truly happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The internal hatred I had for myself had reached what felt like a peak, but somehow still felt like it would continue to get worse. I felt lost, scared and that the potential for me to have a good life was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout all of this, I was able to hide it from the people in my life. I would do this because I did not want to push these negative feelings on anyone else because I didn’t think anyone would take it seriously, and they have their own lives to deal with so why care about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day I opened up about my mental illness\n",
      "However, the day I did find the courage to open up I had not planned on doing it. I was on my way to see a movie with my girlfriend. On the way there the guard I'd had up for so long to hide my internal struggles just crumbled out of the exhaustion of it all and I couldn’t hide it anymore. My girlfriend noticed something was wrong with me and I realised that I had to tell her what was going on, so a little later this is what I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very scary, and it was one of those times where I just couldn’t find the words to describe how I felt and what had been going on. I’ll admit that the guilt of passing this on to my girlfriend and my parents the next day was there. It was scary, but their incredible understanding and support made me feel safe and comfortable, something I had not felt in such a long time. Opening up to them and then my GP would be a great help for me. I am forever grateful for the overwhelming support they gave and continue to give me.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I had not expressed how I was feeling I don’t like to think about what could have happened. But they guided me in the right direction to find myself again and experience real happiness again. It’s still a work in progress, I’m not perfect and I will sometimes make the mistakes I would do in the past. But when all is said and done, the gratitude I have for the continued support will always trump those bad days!\n",
      "I’ve struggled with mental health problems for 4 years now. I started my first year at college, being that independent person my parents always wanted me to be, but then everything just came tumbling down. My family and I all went through a very traumatic time and that’s where it all began.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lost my way a bit. I didn’t want to go to college, I didn’t want go out and socialise like every other teenager would be doing. I locked myself away. Over the following months I found myself rapidly getting worse. I didn’t want to speak to anyone about how I was feeling, especially my family. I always felt like the glue in the family, holding everyone together, so I kept silent with my problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the age of 18 I decided to move out and live on my own. At first I was loving life. Having my own place, my own pets, doing what I wanted when I wanted. Then I slowly realised how lonely I was and how much I was struggling. I was working somewhere where I was getting paid minimum wage so I couldn’t afford anything apart from just about managing to pay the bills. I pushed all my close friends away because I just didn’t want to leave the house. This is when I realised I’d slipped back into depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 3 years of pretending to be this happy, bubbly, energetic character, I just broke. I was tired. Tired of pretending. I pulled myself together and reached out for help. I was finally diagnosed with anxiety, depression and an eating disorder. I felt free in a sense, a massive weight I’d been carrying for 4 years had been lifted off of my shoulders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the process of getting the help I needed, I heard typical comments like ‘just be happy then’, ‘stop worrying so much then and you’ll be fine’. But I also heard things like ‘I didn’t realise you were struggling so much, you hid it so well’. That was the issue, I shouldn’t have had to hide it. I wouldn’t have needed to if people had a better understanding about mental health.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found it so difficult to admit to myself and others around me how much I was struggling. I had and still do have a brilliant support network from my partner, family and a few friends. I knew telling them would be difficult, but I also knew they love me know matter what, which I am so grateful for. It’s the rest of the world that’s scary. The lack of understanding and knowledge that people have towards those with a mental illness. If someone breaks their arm, everyone jumps to them to sign their cast. If someone has a mental health problem, people run because they think we’re unpredictable and strange.\n",

      "People shouldn’t have to lie about taking medication. People shouldn’t have to lie about doctor or counselling appointments. Those with a mental illness should be accepted and treated the same as anyone with a physical health problem. I’ve learnt that it is ok to be a little different. It’s ok not to say you’re not ok. Everyone needs to learn that not every disability is physical. The happiest person you know in life could be the one who is also struggling the most. Make sure they’re ok. It’s time to talk and it’s time to change.\n",
      "I was diagnosed with depression during my final year of medical school. Since then it’s been a struggle of relapses and recovery. Sharing my story makes things easier. If I tell you my experience it’s easier for you to share yours.\n",

      "I remember I wrote a sort of suicide note when I was 12. At that age I self-harmed as well. I didn’t speak to anyone about how I was feeling. What was I going to say? \n",

      "That was the first time I started feeling something wasn’t right, but I didn’t know what it was. Even at medical school, I still couldn’t figure it out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t go to see the doctor out of choice. I was talked into it by my friends. I always think I’m one of the lucky ones - I had friends who knew the signs of depression. A large percentage of Nigerians don’t have access to people who can help them at the early stages of their illness. Most people have to really get in a very bad state to get help.\n",
      "\n",
      "My diagnosis has helped me to accept what’s going on. All I asked for from my friends was to be treated the same way. I'm not fragile - I didn’t want to be treated like an egg. \n",

      "\n",
      "Support from family and peers makes recovery possible. Society has the power to help you accept your diagnosis and seek help. If we create environments where people know its fine to talk about mental health, help-seeking becomes easy. People realise they can walk into a psychiatric hospital without being tagged, ‘mad’. Most people who come to a psychiatric specialist travel from far away to avoid being seen by their neighbours.\n",

      "\n",
      "In politics, if someone does something bad, people say, “that person is mad, get him checked out.” Because society says mentally ill people are crazy and they do all the bad things in society, it is hard for someone like me to accept, actually I am mentally ill. \n",

      "We’ve had people who’ve called to say they don’t want it on their employment record that they have a mental health issue. They ask us to recommend a psychiatric hospital they can go to which won’t record this. Even if it means they have to pay out of pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "We hear from people who have had to deal with it in psychiatric hospitals where even the doctors have stigmatising attitudes. Some therapists tell people, “why don’t you just get better – you’re too young to be mentally ill.” Some psychiatrists let their spirituality influence them. They’ll tell a patient, “I have a pastor who can help you”. \n",

      "You find more Nigerians in churches and mosques than anywhere else. Especially in rural areas, churches can be very judgemental about mental health. They say, ‘a child of God has no business being depressed’. You end up feeling worse. Now even your church, which is supposed to be a support, doesn’t accept you. You’re told you’ve let the devil in and that’s why you’re coping with the darkness of depression. \n",
      "\n",
      "Churches and mosques are such important communities. We want to have conversations with these influential people and ask them, do you think mental health is just a spiritual issue? We don’t want to dismiss the spiritual totally because if you do that you won’t get anywhere. We need to see how we can combine both spiritual and medical recommendations to make sure people get help.\n",

      "Across Africa we have the same sort of issues when it comes to stigma. African parents’ way of raising their children often relies on fear. There is a lack of communication. Children and teenagers are not listened to which makes mental health issues worse.\n",

      "Depression and anxiety is a part of my life. I recognise now that it has been for the majority of my life. But it took a long time for me to realise and accept this. I didn't want to be \"ill\". The stigma surrounding mental illness was built within me, passed down through generations of people \"pulling themselves together\". I'd hear some of those close to me talk about victims of suicide, they would reflect on stories they had heard and use words like selfish and crazy. I remember feeling so much empathy and pain at those words. I understood feeling like my family would be better off without me. Like there wasn't going to be a future that I could play a part in. I thought that was my fault, I thought I was “selfish” too.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't until I was 18 and at university that I knew it wasn't just \"teenage blues\" and I wasn't \"shy and one day you'll grow out it\". I had reached the point in my life where I finally felt some independence. It slowly dawned on me (with the help of a lot of online research, cheers Google), the sweaty, breathy unsuccessful attempts to walk through the door of my uni seminars and the eventual slow tearful walk back to halls, were not just because I was \"shy\". Neither was my \"awkwardness” the reason I would have to ring my friends to come and open their front door, when I arrived at their house, for crippling fear of knocking and not knowing who could be behind it when it opened, having not planned out precisely what I would say and then freeze unable to articulate myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would sleep through the daylight, not eating, not doing anything, just being trapped to the spot and drifting in and out of consciousness. That wasn't because I was \"lazy\". I wasn't just \"heartbroken\" because my boyfriend and I broke up. I was depressed and self-sabotaging, misusing substances and driving people away because I felt unworthy and broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of them did walk away but some stuck around and I'm thankful for both because I know it's difficult to support someone who is unable to admit there is something wrong. The fear of ridicule or claims of \"attention seeking\" made it feel impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now I feel incredibly supported but that hasn't always been the case. It's been about 10 years from my initial realisation and I can see things are shifting slowly (due to campaigns like Time to Change). Mental health is being discussed on the news, people are coming forward with their stories and I no longer feel shame for my struggles but we've still got a lot of work to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took me 10 years to build up the courage and support to get a diagnosis and start on a road to recovery but that wasn't for lack of trying. At times of crisis, I went to those closest to me, I broke down to them to be told to \"get a grip\" or \"just try and be happy\".\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of hours before I got my diagnosis I was asked by a relative \"Are you sure you want to do this? It will be on your medical records, people will make assumptions about you, it might affect your job prospects\". I was furious. It had taken so much fight and feelings of guilt to get to a point where I was ready, I’d felt I had the support of my family, that they finally took me seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, on this occasion, I'm glad they asked me that question because I defied it, it stuck with me and I found strength from within it. Now I talk openly about depression and anxiety. I ask the people around me how they are and then I ask them again. I still see members of my family wince when the neighbour pops over for a cup of tea and asks how I am and what I've been up to. I answer them honestly and await the awkward silence but I also see how proud they are of me for challenging that stigma and for how far I've come. I still dread those kinds of questions some days.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want the people that have touched on those feelings of nothingness or pain, the people who feel it totally consumes them and the people who blow it off as us being \"snowflakes\", to know our feelings are legitimate, we all deserve to be listened to and we are all in this together.\n",
      "I’ve always been rather private when it comes to my mental health. In 2019 I am willing to change that. I really wish mental health wasn’t such a taboo subject and that people did not feel ashamed to speak of their struggles, because it’s not our fault. But that’s the issue with mental illnesses, they cause you to overthink and you end up thinking it is your fault. It’s not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I owe a lot to my counsellor (who has dealt with me week in and week out for over two years). I think that it’s important to stop antidepressants and counselling being such a taboo topic. People are ashamed to admit that they take these daily, or are ashamed to even ask for them. I have been on antidepressants for five months now and when I was placed on them, I was too scared to even tell some of my closest friends because I was scared of being judged. It’s important to recognise that pills aren’t a magic cure for mental illnesses, but that they can help motivate you to take the steps toward feeling better.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a society we need a better approach toward mental health and we need to stop making assumptions. For one, mental illness is different for everyone. Not everyone experiences it in the same way. That also means that people’s problems should not be dismissed just because they don’t present them in the typical form that we expect. Someone can have anxiety but go on a stage in front of thousands. They have overcome the fear, but it doesn’t mean that their anxiety doesn’t exist, or it is less important than someone else’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Someone can have depression but spend their day laughing and smiling. People with depression can have good days too, and they’re also great at faking a smile for the benefit of those around them.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may think someone is “fine” because they’re posting on social media, but social media is fake. It’s usually a presentation of the best parts of our lives and very rarely includes the worst parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also need to stop saying things such as “it could be worse”, “you’re overreacting”, “get over it” or “snap out of it”. These are the kinds of statements which tick over and over in people’s minds and can lead them to think that they shouldn’t speak up. People are afraid of judgement. Don’t make people feel as though they are being judged.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to stop saying that people are “attention seeking”, because speaking about your struggles is something that most people find very difficult to do. As someone who struggles a lot with anxiety issues, I often feel I am being judged when in retrospect it may have been a harmless comment. It is so important to be kind to anyone, at any chance you get, because you have no idea how much your words and actions can impact a person’s mental state. This goes for both positive and negative acts or comments, they can both have a lasting impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh and PLEASE, if you notice someone has scars or wounds which you believe may have been caused by self-harm, do not ask them about it in public. By all means, ask if they’re doing okay, but do it in a one on one situation. Asking someone about this topic when they’re with a group of people is likely to make them clam up, not start a conversation about it which could help them get the help they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you think someone is struggling mentally, just check they’re okay, let them know they matter to you. And to anyone struggling, it is OKAY to want to be alone, alone time can be great , but being in a comfortable environment with friends and family can do a lot of good as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "A simple “how are you doing?” can go a long way, to let someone know that you are thinking of them. You don’t have to understand what they’re going through, you just need to be there for them. \n",
      "\n",
      "And if someone tries to open up to you, let them. Sometimes they don’t even need you to say anything, they just need to feel like someone is listening and they care.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope that everyone, and I mean everyone, not just my close friends, knows that I am here. I know it is an overused statement but I truly mean it. I admit I’m not always great at giving advice but I take myself for a great listener. Don’t be afraid to speak up.\n",
      "To describe what living with depression and anxiety is like to anyone who doesn't understand or hasn't experienced it before is to imagine a weight pulling your body down, so heavy that every day you have to summon up the strength to push against it and to lighten the impact. Some days I'm just about able to ease it off a little and get on with the things I need to; there's still a strain there but it's manageable and I can stave it off for a little while if I’m distracted.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, other times I just don't have the strength and energy to push against it and I feel powerless, completely worn down and unable to move forward. That's what it feels like for me, so intense and so unavoidable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course you can't actually 'see' depression and anxiety the way you might do a physical ailment on the body. On the surface, I smile and talk about the normal things you're supposed to talk about with others and answer 'how are you?' with the expected 'fine thank you, and yourself?'. It can feel like to tell someone you're struggling is to place a massive burden on them, to make them feel uncomfortable, or even worse, there's the fear that it will make them walk away from you.\n",
      "\n",
      "And whilst if the tables were turned and a friend was telling me they were struggling I wouldn't think any of those things, depression and anxiety can make you second-guess everything and feel unworthy of compassion and understanding from others. What people don't see are the days when leaving the house seems like an impossible feat, when just the process of getting dressed is exhausting and distressing, the days where I can't seem to stop crying, when sleeping is the only way to get away from my thoughts, or alternatively when I feel numb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being depressed isn't something that anyone chooses or something that can be solved just by thinking positively (as nice as that would be!). The reality is that you can be a positive person but be consumed by mental illness; you can be seemingly 'fine' on the surface but may have spent hours and hours trying to work up the courage to face another human, even if that’s just going to the corner shop or the post office.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s debilitating and complex and no one experience is the same, but we're trying really really hard. There’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to treatment either. Medication becomes a game of trial and error and quite often the combination of meds and talking therapy is more beneficial; I’ve found that it’s a process of figuring out what works for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of my personal experiences, like many others, supporting campaigns such as Time to Change are so important to me. For a long time I’ve worked hard to conceal my struggles from the people around me, but being passionate about wanting there to be more understanding and empathy around mental health issues, writing this feels like a small step in the right direction.\n",
      "I was told that my reason for being depressed was “pathetic”, and that I “had plenty of things going” for myself, but depression doesn’t work like that. It doesn’t look at what you have going on in life and avoid you because it doesn’t want to ruin that. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted the people I care for and confided in to open their hearts and minds to understand that depression isn’t a choice. I didn’t want to be depressed - nobody wants to be depressed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Being told I was wrong for being depressed, made me feel even more hopeless and incapable of overcoming it with the ‘’weak mind’’ that I was being told I had. I felt like a burden to those I cared about and as if I had let my family and friends down, for letting what was considered “a bad mood” get the better of me. I was told that I had a history of being depressed for so long, that I’d probably be depressed forever - and that it was only a matter of time till there would be another thing that happened to trigger it all over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I sought therapy to prevent that from happening, the person I trusted enough to confide in made me feel like my reasons weren’t worthy enough to seek professional help over; they would have been able to get over it all easily or not let it bother them.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I still went to therapy, and it wasn’t a pointless road to go down. My reasons were just as valid as anyone else’s, and without help, my mind would have been stuck in the same place forever and the hopeless thoughts would have taken over me. It took strength to battle my depression and courage to grab the bull by the horns.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it’s easy for someone who has no experience with it personally, to assume that people who are depressed or experiencing thoughts of suicide are weak - but that’s wrong. They aren’t weak, they are alone in their thoughts and tired of battling it till they’ve lost their ability to think. I think it’s important to let people experiencing suicidal thoughts or any level of depression know they are not alone and give them positive energy to feed off. Show them that there is support available and there is still beauty in life!  Even if you don’t understand or can’t relate to people in these positions, it can help just to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you suffer with your mental health or know anyone who does, remember that depression can start at any time and can happen to anyone. No one is immune to mental health issues like anxiety and depression, and what triggers you may or may not be the same as what triggers someone else. You’re still strong and there’s still a solution to the problem. It can be cured.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want others who are struggling with their mental health to trust that there’s light at the end of the tunnel and to encourage themselves to face the reality of how they are feeling. Accept that it’s not anything to be ashamed of – and it can be overcome.\n",
      "I remember the first time I vocalised and admitted the fact that I was struggling with depression and anxiety. Following seven years of sporadic periods of chronic anxiety and panic attacks induced by both smoking marijuana as a teenager and my parents’ break up, I was at university, 22 and suffering a reactive bout of depression triggered by the break-up of a tumultuous relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "The university referred me to a counsellor and during my first session, I cried and cried. I felt incredibly exposed and ashamed about how I felt and for the way in which I was dealing with anything disrupting my life and mental health. He ultimately delved very directly into my childhood, where my issues and insecurities may have stemmed from. My father’s affair and subsequent parental divorce, the breakdown of my family unit and loss of my childhood home, my own striving for aesthetic perfection (after being put on a pedestal to perform and entertain by my well-meaning parents), my body dysmorphia disorder and my anxious outlook on the world stemming from an over protective parent all arose.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a minefield of information and facts, which were both overwhelming and numbing. Slowly I started to process and understand how immediate circumstances, upbringing and ingrained deep-seated damage all contributed towards the way I felt in general, and how I reacted to certain situations. Fifteen years later, this is still a work in progress!\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about my mental health made a huge difference\n",
      "Many of my early mental health conversations actually took place with my wise, incredibly open and beloved late grandmother, following my counselling. Not only were we very close, she was also not a direct parent and slightly removed from my household so she could give me a more objective viewpoint. Despite our 58-year age gap, she had the mind and attitudes of a person of my age and even though she never professed to having suffered from much emotional strain in her life, she was an empath and very interested in psychology / anthropology. She listened and gave measured, kind advice and allowed me to talk without interruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of how this made me feel, I am now especially keen to encourage others to talk, and embrace the benefit of being open and unashamed. Just by being open, intuitive, sensitive and encouraging, people without mental health problems can provide a safe platform for others - friends / family / colleagues - to open up when may not have done so if nobody had recognised their behaviours, signs and symptoms. I always reach out if I sense or see that someone is in need, and give them the option to talk to me if they so wish. I know how important and meaningful this is to some who feel they do not want to burden others with their ‘problems’ having been on the other side of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still get bouts of the black dog and I feel it is important to recognise if there are any catalysts or triggers (including hormones) and this makes it easier to understand and thus to work through. Talking in small social groups, a phone call with a friend or writing down how I feel all help me to ‘emotionally vomit’ or ‘do a wee out of my eyes’. I draw these humorous yet strangely accurate comparisons to being poorly with food poisoning or a bug, or needing the loo – the toxins need to exit the body in order for you to begin your physical recovery. It is no different with emotional illness. I refer to the latter particularly when people need to cry and try to stifle it. It is important to listen to one’s body. Humour and self-deprecation often help me to help others and myself… of course considering another person’s boundaries and approaching things with discretion and sensitivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trying to break down a mass of issues into individual challenges rather than perceiving things as one huge lump of problem also really helps.\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been far too much stigma attached to admitting we are struggling with our mental health, let alone opening up enough to talk about it. It is positive to reason out and rationalise things with others; and ourselves - verbally or written. This is especially important when people are not struggling with a mental health problem to be educated and familiarised with the concept; the reality that so many have to live often form an hour-to-hour basis just to get through. There are still barriers to mental health whether it be ignorance, lack of information and understanding or lack of first-hand experience but I am confident that day by day, week by week, month by month and year by year this is dissipating within society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I have opened my can of metaphorical brain worms, I will never seal it again.\n",
      "It’s interesting trying to explain the agony that depression brought into my life to people who are not depressed. I find that people who haven’t fought that particular battle have difficulty understanding what I mean when I say I was not in physical pain per se but I was in excruciating torment nonetheless. Physically, I’m sure my body showed no signs of peril.\n",
      "\n",
      "And publicly, I never let my guard down for fear of judgement. But emotionally, I was aflame with terror and self-hatred. As someone who has struggled with eating disorders and anxiety since I was twelve, I am somewhat used to intense personal turmoil. Depression was something else. It was as if there was a cavity in my soul that was sore and inflamed with sorrow and loneliness. I had to clutch myself, my arms wrapped tightly around my torso, to keep from disintegrating. It was as if I had been punched in the chest by an iron-clad fist. A hole in my heart yearned for healing and love. And after so many years of fighting to make my body smaller, more frail, devoid of life, I was stunned to once again realize that the option of death seemed more logical than any attempt at life. Reason failed in that moment. Depression’s perversion of reality trumped the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not take my life. I survived the moment where I was my most lethal enemy. But whenever I try to tell people about what happened, they don’t seem to understand where my desire to end the pain would come from, unless they also have fought mental health battles. The power of depression is remarkable. It can effectively convince you that despite your connections, your family, your ability, or your friends, you are worthless and alone in the world, that you will never be loveable, and that your existence is a colossal mistake. I want others who don’t battle depression to understand that you will never be able to tell that someone is depressed just by looking at them. I hid my struggle so well that my own family, a loving, wonderful support system, were blindsided. Making the disease invisible was a personal pride of mine, because then I could convince the world that I was not weak or pathetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression doesn't have a look\n",
      "The stereotypes of people with depression are extensive. They range from people not being able to get out of bed, shower, eat, or leave their house. And while these are definite truths for some people, depression is like snowflakes: No two are the same. My depression has its own ways of manifesting itself in my behaviours and thoughts. But someone else’s could be the polar opposite. Which makes neither more or less valid than the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asking for help does not make a person feeble. In fact, it does the opposite. It fortifies you. It demonstrates your willingness to fight for yourself. It makes you the hero of your own story. One day, I hope we can unite on the idea that depression is not a disgraceful condition. And for people who do not experience depression but may know someone who does, be a friend to them. Be gentle and patient. They are fighting every day to overcome an invisible barrier. You don’t have to understand what they’re feeling, just that a little empathy can go a long way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I no longer carry shame for what I experience. I hope many others do in the future so that isolation due to mental health might one day be an object of the past.\n",
      "Depression has been a part of my life for over 10 years; yet I still don’t fully understand it. So, how do I explain what “it” is to someone who has no experience of depression in their life?\n",
      "\n",
      "In all honesty, I’ve rarely been asked to explain what depression means to me. You say the word and people either turn away in fear or they try to relate in attempts to console and/or fill the silence. When really, all I need is for someone to ask “And how does depression affect you?”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression, for me, is another soul taking over my mind and body. It cohabits day in day out in attempts to knock my confidence, whispering insults in my ear. And I can live with this; I know it is a part of me and I’m grateful to merely exist – so if I have to share with depression then so be it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The struggle comes when depression really takes over, and I forget my strength, vitality and the love I have for those around me. Every word, action, or passing glance is an attack. My body aches and all I want to do is sleep until the pain goes away. If someone tries to ask me how I’m feeling or what’s going on in my head, I can’t answer them. I become so overwhelmed by the pure negativity that I shut down to protect myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first few years, my coping mechanism was self-harm. I didn’t do it to “feel something” or to punish myself. I self-harmed so that the pain would stop – in the brief moments afterwards I felt a sense of calm and control. This was fleeting, and as with any addiction, I needed more of it to achieve the same results. Before long I was hurting myself “just because” and to this day there are months of my life that I cannot remember – my brain has shut off the memories because they are too harmful.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scars act as a reminder that I may have lost some battles, but I’m winning the war. When strangers stare in confusion, or whisper to their friend who turns in shock – it hurts. I vividly remember parties when other girls would gather, laughing and pointing – the world can be a cruel place. But when someone approaches me with kindness and asks about my scars, I feel hopeful, and explain that “I have depression and that’s how I used to cope, but I’m okay now”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kind words can open the door to a conversation that not only helps me to understand my depression, but potentially helps others to understand it too.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you know someone who might be struggling, I ask that you give them your time and patience...\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression makes me feel worthless, insignificant and burdensome, I won't ask you for help, because I don't have the strength. Please could you sit down with me, and let me know that you are 'here'? I might not be able to talk about feelings, but ask \"how do you feel today?\" and I'd know that you care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please don't be offended when I don't respond - sometimes the only way of coping is to shut you, and everything else, out. I might snap back at you, or say \"I'm fine\"; when we both know that's not true. Stay with me, even in silence, tears, anger and irritation - don't ask \"Why? What? How? When?\" Just tell me you're here when I'm ready to talk, and maybe one day I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Find something that brings me back to moment, and allows me to escape (however briefly) the depression. My favourite food, film, a walk with the dogs, making plans for the holidays, a tub of Ben & Jerry's! Hope that I might be able to share what's going on in my head - but give me time, don't push for answers. Ask what I need from you, and one day I might know.\n",
      "\n",
      "If each person reading this held out their hand to someone in pain, it might start the conversation that helps, even just a little bit.\n",
      "Many people might think of a period of poor mental health as being incapable of getting out of bed in the morning, or a severe lack of motivation and reluctance to do anything. Certainly, for many people these symptoms are prominent at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, some who are living with a mental illness, or generally struggling with mental health, are high-functioning. They still live out their day-to-day lives like normal. They go to work, socialise, and function like anyone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, because they seem perfectly ‘normal’ on the outside, when they choose to be open about their mental health, they’re often met with the phrase, ‘you can’t be dealing with that much if you’re still able to get out of bed in the morning’.\n",
      "\n",
      "A terribly frustrating sentence that I, as someone who is high-functioning, and others with similar conditions hear far too often. Although I’m sure (well, I hope!) these comments aren’t intended to cause harm, and likely descend from ignorance around mental health in general, they really need to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having a high-functioning mental illness does not put you in a category above others dealing with mental health. It doesn’t mean you’ve got a strong grasp of your condition and understand how to manage it. It doesn’t mean your struggles are less than those who cannot function in the same way, and of course doesn’t mean yours are worse. Everyone’s issues are relative.\n",
      "\n",
      "What it does mean is that you are trying to get on with your day, doing your best, all the while struggling to keep the impending anxiety, depression or other mental health issues hidden away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember in 2016, I had an assessment with a mental health practitioner to discuss types of therapy I might benefit from.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the assessment, I was asked a series of questions around how my mental health affects me on a day-to-day basis. I remember half way through the assessment she said, ‘So what help do you need exactly? People with mental health issues can barely get themselves out of the house, they have no motivation to do anything. Are you sure you’re not just having a bad few weeks?’. I understand she’s the professional, but unfortunately, she completely invalidated my mental wellbeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I panicked and immediately started backtracking. I felt like I had to lie about my symptoms because they didn’t seem ‘good’ or ‘correct’ enough to actually get any help, and that I was stupid for finally taking steps to get help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now of course, I’m not saying all mental health practitioners are like this; it’s just that in this instance, I didn’t have the best experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thankfully, I pushed forward and was put on a waiting list to receive some help. Flash forward a few years and I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder.\n",
      "\n",
      "What if I walked away from that assessment? Accepting that I had to have x, y and z as symptoms in order to be valid in what I was feeling? I might have continued living with mental health conditions that I didn’t understand, and no idea that I needed help.\n",
      "\n",
      "From speaking to many who live with mental health issues and are high-functioning, I discovered that feeling invalidated is a common theme.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stigma is slowly breaking as more of us are speaking out. I believe it’s incredibly important we erase this idea that you must behave in certain ways or display specific types of emotions and symptoms to truly have a mental health issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every single person on this planet is unique, and so is their experience with mental health. If I was put in a room with several different people who had been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, we wouldn’t all behave in the same ways. It doesn’t mean each symptom associated with this mental illness will affect each and every one of us in the same way. The same applies to any mental health issue or illness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we need to challenge the idea that we must tick a stereotypical box to have a ‘real’ mental health problem. Let’s not dismiss those who share their struggles, even if it seems they are functioning. I believe we have to stop invalidating people because we are conditioned to assume mental health appears a certain way, and we have to continue breaking the stigma.\n",
      "People won't always know if you're struggling. Sometimes it feels like being silent is the only viable option. After all, why would you want to burden someone else with your problems?\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was at sixth form college, I found it hard to balance college assignments with my part-time work. Evening and weekend shifts were taking up a lot of free time. I was burning myself out. The anxiety around achieving the right grades for uni was making me stressed. My workplace was not supportive when it came to my mental health challenges. Feeling depressed wasn't a choice. It was a natural reaction to my personal circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "My GP recommended activities to help me feel better. Some of these involved going outside. Work penalised this by issuing written and verbal warnings. The reason being that I wasn't housebound during my sick leave. The worst moment was when I tried to confide in my line manager that I was experiencing severe depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sick note had \"stress\" as the reason because that is what I asked my GP to write. I asked them to write this because I found it embarrassing to be honest about the true nature of my illness. My line manager scoffed when they saw \"stress\" on my sick note. How could someone of my age feel stressed?\n",
      "\n",
      "When I said it was depression, they started laughing at me. This made me feel like a joke. My depression felt invalid.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ended up dropping out of college during the second year. At this moment in time, it wasn't right for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't until a few years after when I moved on from my part-time job and started an apprenticeship in the public sector. This was a different experience. I found it easier discussing my personal circumstances with my new line manager. My circumstances included ongoing domestic abuse, and long-term consequences from historic abuse. This was affecting my performance at work, and even my ability to arrive on-time. I ended up sharing a lot with my line manager over the course of my apprenticeship.\n",
      "\n",
      "They never laughed at my circumstances, nor any of my speculative diagnoses. My depression was not invalidated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I learned something valuable from these two very different experiences. Both involved me opening up about my struggle with mental illness. Both involved line managers, who provided contrasting reactions. What I learned was that the reaction you receive says more about that person than it does you.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, I attended a mental health hospital as a voluntary in-patient. I am not afraid of telling you that the reason for my admission was acute psychosis. My anxiety was getting out of control and I was experiencing delusions. I believed that I was not safe outside. I believed that everyone was watching me. This time, I was honest from the beginning about why I needed time off work.\n",
      "\n",
      "My line manager was understanding. They had the emotional intelligence not to penalise me for a lapse in my mental wellbeing. I was in hospital for over one month before being discharged back to my GP. I met with my line manager outside of work for lunch. We talked about the best way to help me return to work and college without burning myself out.\n",
      "\n",
      "We agreed on a phased return to work plan. I received flexible time off to attend mental health-related appointments. I could not have asked for a more understanding and empathetic line manager during this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same can be said of my college tutors. They were aware of the recent events, and had regular check-ins with me. I didn't always feel like I deserved their time and attention. I even said this to them at times. They always assured me that their job is to help me achieve the best of my ability. I am grateful for the time and efforts from my line manager and college tutors. It is thanks to them that I not only completed my apprenticeship, but also developed the skills to progress to a new position. I'm still in the public sector so that pension pot is still growing ;)\n",
      "\n",
      "You can't assume everyone will react the way you want when you open up about your mental health challenges. But you won't get any reaction unless you speak up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hold on. What if I’m on the receiving end? What’s the correct thing to say? What kind of reaction is right?\n",
      "\n",
      "It might be easier to first tell you what kind of reaction I believe is wrong. It's one that dismisses what you've been told as nonsense or something silly. For example, I recently revealed some details about my anxiety to a work colleague. I told them that I am always on edge. No matter where I go, I can't seem to relax.\n",
      "\n",
      "They told me to \"just chill out\".\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a bad response and demonstrates weak emotional intelligence. In this scenario, it would have been acceptable, and intelligent, to ask questions like:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Has there ever been a time when you didn't feel like this?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How do you manage those feelings?\"\n",

      "I love learning. Particularly about the mind and behaviour, in both humans and animals. This was my reason to go to university, to pursue the desire to learn, coming out with a better understanding of a topic I was passionate in. I knew it wouldn’t be easy, but I didn’t know it would be this hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I started university, I spent my gap year trapped in depression, anxiety, and social anxiety. This unfortunate combination made me only desire to go to learn, keep my head down, and hope that people wouldn’t dislike me. I didn’t consider making friends or growing personally, as I thought this wasn’t obtainable to me. I was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "University has pushed me both positively and negatively. It made me do things that my mind told me I couldn’t do but would have to do for the pursuit of academic success. Sitting in large lecture rooms, having seminars, group projects – all things that seemed impossible I somehow accomplished. I’ve grown a lot in confidence and my social anxiety has lessened, mainly thankful to the wonderful people at university. Opening up to other people about struggling with my mental health and them doing the same has provided me with rich and wonderful relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, university has been extremely challenging and many times I did not think I’d make it. The stress that results from the pressures of; assignments, finances, the impossible work-life balance has greatly damaged my mental health. Feeling consumed and overwhelmed everyday was awful, while also feeling I was the only one feeling the pressure making things worse. I can’t count the amount of times I have cried endlessly from the pressure or told myself that I have to drop out of university or even life from due to feeling such distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being a perfectionist has made all of the above much harder than it needs to be. Getting good grades, attending every lecture, looking “together” – all aren’t people’s stereotypical view of an individual with mental health problems. If I was struggling, then I should show it behaviourally, or have nothing to worry about as my grades were good. Yet none of this matters when you are feeling so distressed. The fact that I had to be a certain way to be deserving of help made it very hard for me to try and ask for help and has prevented me from asking many times.\n",
      "\n",
      "What has bothered me the most about my experience of university while living with mental health problems is the ideas that are imposed in academic culture. I distinctly remember being told that “Everyone feels this stressed but you have to learn to manage it to be able to do other things in the future. Everyone feels this way”. Not feeling alone is helpful, yet without the resources, how is anyone meant to cope? Academia seems to suggest that we should be stressed, devoting all our time and energy to studying, working towards burn out. Through any means, focussing on university should be paramount to everything else, regardless of your circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "That should not be the way. For students to do well and be able to manage long-term, mental health must be considered. Not all students have mental health problems, but all of them have mental health, which in such a culture is not prioritised. I have seen on a wide scale how my peers have struggled and been let down. Services at university are overwhelmed, with advocating looking after student mental health rarely being mentioned, when it should be a priority. Feeling like universities don’t care is one of the hardest things to come to terms with, especially as students are dedicating their time and money to these institutions for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless, I am somehow nearly finished with my last year at university and I’m not sure how I got here. Things are still extremely hard, I can recall a panic attack that nearly made me pass out when writing my dissertation last month, yet I’m still managing. I am extremely proud of myself for continuing, and only could do so through; therapy, supportive friends/family, and recently medication. I have learnt so much, both academically and personally, and I am glad that I stayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "What has really pleased me is that my university is participating in University Mental Health Day, which shows me that they do care and are encouraging discussing mental health. To all students that are struggling: You are valid and deserve help regardless of the level of distress that you are in. Be real with yourself and other people, as being vulnerable is not a sign of weakness, but is a\n",
      "strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "If someone you know at university is struggling with a mental health problem be there for them and encourage them to talk just by asking how they are. It doesn’t have to be a lot, but showing you’re in their corner really makes the difference.\n",
      "Mental health awareness is being raised everywhere at the moment. It is a vital step towards ending the stigma surrounding mental health. There is still a lot of work to be done, but it is a start. Stigma is still out there and it is silencing people struggling who need our help!\n",
      "\n",
      "I spent a lot of my adolescence numbing the pain. I'd get wasted most nights, it meant I didn't have to face the reality of my existence and the 1001 thoughts running through my head would be temporarily slowed down. I was on top of the world, the sadness and pain would be pushed down but then the hangover would kick in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually did try to reach out for help. I remember standing in front of the people who society tells you would help you no matter what and saying what I did and why. The response: uncomfortable glances and shifting and \"You shouldn't do that\". Then it was buried and to this day no one has ever mentioned it. Once, I asked to see a counsellor and even went to the doctors to get the ball rolling. But because I felt completely unsupported and isolated from those closest to me I couldn’t go through with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those experiences made me feel ashamed and that I had to keep my mouth shut. I felt that I should never burden others with my problems or make them uncomfortable. I was made to feel that someone more important had it worse than me and they were the priority and I was the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember feeling terrified whilst uttering the words and terrified that someone knew my secret. I learnt to smile on the outside and fall apart on the inside. And no, I was not an addict. I only did this when my illness showed up, hung about and refused to leave. I was self-destructive and thought I deserved what was happening to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mental illness stigma can make things worse for those struggling and can delay or impede them getting the help they need. The misconceptions still exist that people with mental health problems are dangerous, violent, criminal and unable to live a \"normal\" life. The media often doesn't help with these views either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some of the things that have been said to me, and people I know, when struggling with a mental health problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why would you want to burden other people?\n",
      "Taking medication makes you weak.\n",
      "Stop attention seeking.\n",
      "YOU ARE CRAZY\n",
      "Therapy is for crazy people\n",
      "Other people have it worse.\n",
      "You should appreciate what you have.\n",
      "It's all in your head.\n",
      "They have an actual physical illness, you don't.\n",
      "They have suffered more than you.\n",
      "Suck it up.\n",
      "Man up.\n",
      "Just deal with it\n",
      "\n",
      "The list could go on......\n",
      "\n",
      "Unhelpful and harmful comments like these are still being said to people who get up every morning and dread facing another day.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're sat there gossiping about Susan who has had it rough lately but needs to pull herself together and get over it, then you're belittling someone’s mental health. The person you're speaking to could be struggling in silence and you are reinforcing their belief that they should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The advice of opening up and asking for help is well meant. But we don’t want to be a burden. The shame and guilt are overwhelming; the fear of being rejected is suffocating. Being thought of as selfish and believing them, being made to feel worthless and struggling in silence is hell. Yet being belittled and having every bad thought confirmed isn’t any better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression can have a bad end game. People never really understand that until it happens. More than one life is affected when it does happen and there aren’t always signs. Yet if there is even the slightest hint that someone is struggling or if they have outright told you, then step up. There is no shame in having a mental illness. Don’t wait until someone’s asking for help. Someone struggling with a mental health problem may never ask, not because they expect your help, or don’t want it, but because they don’t want to burden you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world still needs to catch up. Hidden illnesses are still illnesses and no matter what they are, these people deserve empathy and understanding. Think before you speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best ways to challenge the stigma, is to talk to or hear from people with experience of mental health problems. Be part of the solution.\n",
      "Hi I’m Nayena, a young champion for Time To Change. I love writing, art, and music. Nothing makes me happier than good vegan food. My friends say I’m a calm, witty, and positive person. I’ve also been diagnosed with depression and anorexia. For too long, I’ve been terrified of speaking out about my mental health. But here I am, telling my story.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s changed? Mostly, I have accepted myself. I’m not ashamed of my depression, nor my anorexia. I refuse to feel shame for something that has sculpted my life, widened my horizons, and shown me to be stronger than I ever thought possible. Yes, mental illness is awful, but it has made me the person I am today - I have met so many incredible people and I have discovered a passion for mental health activism that has opened so many doors for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mental illness does not discriminate. It can affect anyone, whether you’re a person of colour or white or gay or trans or male or female.\n",
      "\n",
      "You were likely surprised by my diagnosis of anorexia, due to the very specific picture of the disorder portrayed in media. Unlike the image of anorexia so often represented, I am a person of colour. Unlike the image of anorexia so often represented, I don’t look emaciated. Unlike the image of anorexia so often represented, I never did. But I had my struggle, and it was made unnecessarily harder by people who were too blinded by their own ideas of anorexia to fight for me. Friends, family, therapists: none of them took me seriously until it was very nearly too late.\n",
      "\n",
      "My disordered eating started when I was 13, as a way of coping with a world that I felt I didn’t belong in. It worsened for two years before someone reached out to me. Those were the most isolating and exhausting two years of my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first, I convinced myself my fear of food was nothing to worry about, purely because of the internalised stigma I had surrounding eating disorders. I thought eating disorders couldn’t happen to people like me, much less deserve help when they were suffered by people like me. When I thought of anorexia, I thought of young, white, skinny teenage girls who took a diet too far and landed themselves in hospital. While that may be one story, it is one of millions. And somewhere in the millions of stories is mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I became ill with anorexia, I was not trying out a diet. I did not make a decision one day to just ‘stop eating’. I didn’t ever go to hospital. When I became ill with anorexia, it was a way of coping. I was extremely depressed, although didn’t know this at the time. My home life was unstable, and I clung to this illness with all I had. I did all I could to ensure my family didn’t notice, and although my school friends noticed, they said nothing. They were too blinded by their own idea of what an eating disorder looked like, and dismissed mine for a long time. After a year or so I realised I had a problem, but still didn’t believe I was sick enough to seek help.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason no-one noticed my eating disorder is that to the outside world, I just looked ‘healthy’.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was praised by my friends for my willpower to exercise every day without fail and never touch junk food. I looked a healthy weight, was technically a ‘healthy weight’ (whatever that means), and yet I would faint whilst working out and fall over if I stood up too quickly. I looked healthy and yet I was a shell of a person, whose life revolved around calorie counting and obsessively exercising. I have vivid memories of my legs shaking as I walked into the exam hall to do my GCSEs - not because I was anxious, but because every step further took energy my body no longer had. All I could think about was food. At my lowest, I was suicidal, self-harming, spending weeks in bed. It was a time of my life that is so odd to think about because I was not myself at all. The memories are so vivid but they don’t feel like they are my own. I was really, very lost. What has stuck with me, this entire time, is this feeling of invalidity. This feeling of not being ‘sick enough’.\n",
      "\n",
      "After years of struggling, in early 2018 I finally decided I was sick of being sick. I decided I would give recovery my best shot and see where it took me. Where it has taken me has been incredible. I would love to tell you that I woke up the next morning and did yoga and everything’s been fine since, but that is not the reality of recovery. I live with my depression every day and my eating disorder is still always there. I am a firm believer that things don’t just get better, but that you get better at dealing with them. I am infinitely stronger than I believed myself to be a few years ago. I have grown so much, I have learnt so much, I have laughed so much. Recovery for me is still struggling sometimes but knowing that I can pick myself back up again the next morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "My message for Eating Disorders Awareness Week is that you are ‘sick enough’, the moment you do not feel 100%. There is no measure that can determine whether you need help; only you know how you feel and what would help you. And sometimes, you don’t even know what would help. But acknowledging and expressing how you feel is invaluable.\n",
      "\n",
      "What did help, for me? A combination of things: therapy, medication, writing, music. And also friends, family, cats. Somedays what has helped most is a friend calling me up and asking if I want to go for coffee and have a chat. Somedays it’s been a family member cooking for me when I couldn’t myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mental illness is complex but supporting someone with it doesn’t have to be. Just make sure you look after yourself first, because you cannot pour from an empty glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I can’t emphasise enough is that there is no standard of sickness for you to deserve help. You deserve help when you doubt you need it. Also, your worst days in recovery will still be better than your best days in your illness. Talking helps. People are far more understanding than you think they’ll be, because there really is no shame in whatever you’re going through. All you need to do is give yourself and those around you a chance.\n",
      "I can’t quite believe how much my life has changed since my previous blog in 2015. I left my science communication job to become a science technician (never leaving science education, obviously!), and my personal life has had some massive upheaval too.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing that hasn’t changed is the effect of my work on my mental health and, conversely, the effect of my mental health on my work. I didn’t tell my new manager about my depression until my circumstances changed so drastically that I knew it would affect my work. I’d already been in my current role for a year by then so I knew and trusted my department, but I still didn’t feel I could “go public” about my depression. \n",
      "\n",
      "A few months later, it got to a point where I’d started having panic attacks at work, and just my manager and HR director wasn’t enough. So, very nervously, I told the rest of my department one lunchtime. They were so supportive and wanted to do whatever they could to help me. They don’t treat me any differently, and they take a genuine interest in how I am. I finally felt like I’d found a workplace where I could feel valued and settled, and it meant so much to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "That all fell apart when my manager told us he was leaving: it came as a total shock. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was terrifying telling my new manager, someone I’d known for one day, about my depression - I had no idea how he’d react.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d needn’t have worried because he handled it brilliantly. I told him I’d had depression for a long time, I was managing it with my GP and that it wasn’t really affecting work at that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, within a week I’d been told to book an emergency appointment with my GP because I’d been experiencing suicidal thoughts, and that I should consider reducing my hours at work. It turned out to be the start of many weeks of informal catch-ups, meetings with HR and occupational health, counselling and breakdowns before being signed off work and coming back on a phased return. But my department, my manager and HR director have been fantastic, and with their support I’ve got a Wellness Action Plan in place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being back at work, and feeling so empowered to talk about my mental health with my colleagues, has had such a positive impact on my life. I’ve got amazing support at work. My colleagues are now used to me commandeering a glorified cupboard so that I can listen to music and do some colouring in when life feels a little overwhelming. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s nice knowing that, slowly but surely, I’m getting well again. I had an amazing moment this week when I compared my occupational health report from just before I was signed off work three months ago with the one from last week - it’s unreal to think how far I’ve come in that time, thanks to the support I’ve had from my friends, family and work, and my own hard work.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friends and family have been amazing during this turbulent time as well. They’ve encouraged me to speak to my GP and to my manager, spoken to me on the phone at stupid o’clock and dealt with me turning up unannounced on their doorsteps. They’ve reminded me of who I am when depression isn’t clouding my judgement, and that they’ve always loved me and always will. \n",
      "\n",
      "My life has changed so much - I’ve lost people who were my rock, but I’ve made some fantastic new friends along the way. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve learned a lot about myself, and what I need to stay well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Self-care isn’t all cake and bubble baths - it’s about survival. Some days it’s remembering to brush your teeth, to eat and drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve discovered new hobbies like singing in a choir and going to the gym. I thought they were extravagant, but I and others noticed how much my health deteriorated when I stopped doing them. I’ve also started meditating - originally I’d pooh-poohed the idea, but taking time each day to just “be” is so grounding.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my previous blog, I said how one day I’d be more open about my mental health. I’m so glad I’ve reached that point, even if it took me a few years to get there. I’ve taken ownership of my depression, and I’m proud of how much I’ve achieved. The fact that my openness has encouraged others to seek help for their mental health issues, or even just think about mental health, is incredible. I always said I’d have my “small but perfectly formed” support network to thank, and I do - it’s just now it’s a different group of people, and it’s a lot bigger.\n",
      "I remember when someone first spoke to me about my mental health. I'd had a panic attack in college, something that happened quite frequently despite me not realising what a panic attack was at the time, but this time a tutor noticed and advised me to visit a doctor. At this point I thought nothing of it since I'd put my anxiety symptoms down to a physical issue rather than a mental issue, despite struggling with it for two years already, and so I agreed to book a doctor's appointment the following day. It turned out this would be the first visit of many and that a lot of my mental health I had been in denial about was about to come to light.\n",
      "\n",
      "This blog is the first time I've opened up about this on such a large scale and I was very hesitant about doing it, until I realised that being hesitant is the reason mental health has been such a stigmatised topic for so long. If talking about my story helps just one person to start a conversation then I guess it's worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February 2018, at the age of 18, I was admitted to a psychiatric unit for the first time. I was struggling with depression, anxiety and an eating disorder. Along with weight, I lost all hope of ever getting better. The next two months that followed in my first hospital admissions were the most difficult and scary months of my life and led to me being sectioned under the Mental Health Act for my own safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past year I was admitted three times in total to two different psychiatric units, kept overnight for observation on two other occasions, received home treatment on three occasions, and attended A&E a further three times for assessment following crisis. All of this led to me making the decision to defer my entry to university to focus on getting better.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this time, talking to the people close to me about my mental health has kept me going. My friends have been my rocks from visiting me in hospital to supporting me in my return to college. My tutors were amazing during this too: if they hadn’t taken me to hospital I may not have been able to sit my A levels and get the grades I did. I now have an even bigger support network helping me from people in work, the support workers at the hostel where I live, and the mental health professionals in charge of my care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through my experience I learned that discussions about mental health are so important, and my situation could have been so different if people hadn't stepped in to talk about my mental health. I'm still struggling a lot and have lots of appointments and a care and treatment plan in place to try and avoid hospital admissions, but I've got a large support network around me that are there to look out for me when I'm too ill to look out for myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's so much stigma and misconceptions about mental illness when you compare it, for example, to physical illness. That needs to change. Talking can make such a difference, it's so important that people are able to open up about how they’re feeling.\n",
      "As I psych myself up to write this, I contemplate how many things I have had to psych myself up for already today...getting out of bed, getting washed, brushing my hair, eating, driving to work, focusing on conversations, meeting deadlines, remembering what I have to do and in what order, and this is all before midday. This has been a part of my 'routine' for the last 15 years and it is exhausting.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have always been an anxious person but this developed into an eating disorder when I was 15 and I was diagnosed with depression at around 21, when I knew I needed to talk to somebody about the severity of my mental health issues. Nothing in particular triggered my anxiety and depression; a fact that made it harder for those around me to understand. I hid it for years and thought I was coping through self-harm. I was wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I finally told my parents, after 7 years of gradually growing apart because of this unspoken truth that lay between us, I thought all my problems would be solved. It turns out, talking is only the beginning. What I didn't realise was how hard it is for loved ones to come to terms with such devastating news, and I realised that they had no idea how to treat me once they knew that I had been struggling in silence. They blamed themselves, they referred to it as a phase, they suggested remedies, they trod on eggshells. Just when I thought I could breathe again, the air was sucked out of me by all of these overwhelming reactions, making me feel I had to hide again. They needed support as much as I did, which is partly why I am writing this blog. It took another 5 years to tell them that the problem hadn't gone away with time; it wasn't a phase, and that I am now medicated to help me cope.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is, those with mental illness don't need a quick fix. We don't need lots of presents. We don't need to feel guilty that we didn't speak out sooner. We don't need to be reminded of how lucky we are and how it could be worse. We need you to listen, to check in, to educate yourself, to accept this part of us. To understand that what we are going through is real and the longer it is hidden away, the longer it takes for us to bring it into the open and get support.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been two years since I have self-harmed, but not a day since I haven't fought with my own thoughts and felt exhausted after playing the part each and every day. I have since told some of my colleagues and those who have understood have made me want to be here longer. My best friends who call just to see how I am doing that day, have made the worst days bearable by making me feel safe to talk. My mental health disorders haven't vanished and still cause me no end of pain, but I can finally see a light at the end of a very dark tunnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The times I have felt most supported have been over a cup of tea, talking freely about my conditions, without fear of judgment. There is such a long way to go, and not everyone in my life is as supportive as others. I still have days when I am looked at in pity or told to 'Smile, it’s not the end of the world'. If nothing else comes from this, I hope one person chooses to ask and listen to those of us who are begging internally for support but are terrified to say it out loud. Those who did saved my life. Be those people.\n",
      "It all started as just a few thoughts. \n",
      "\n",
      "But over time, I started having extremely bad anxiety and was becoming more depressed. School was using the little effort I had left. I gave up all my after-school clubs, all sporting events. I wouldn't eat at school or at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few months, I reached out to my friends about what was happening. But sadly, at that time they just came out with remarks about how I was being ungrateful and it was all for attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt extremely judged. Their comments made me feel worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "I started self-harming and had suicidal thoughts. I was angry at myself, at everyone. I felt isolated even though I was sat with a big group of friends each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the beginning of next summer I had hit rock bottom. I kept thinking that suicide would be a way out whenever something bad happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end a friend noticed something was up and reached out to me. She supported me all summer and helped me work my way through my thoughts. She spent time just talking and it made me feel better. A few days during the summer she came to my house and we just watched funny movies, cooked lunch together and just had a laugh. But it was as little as asking how I was feeling that made me feel like someone cared about me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told my parents and they helped me, and I got the help I needed from professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I'm doing well in school. I can say I'm happy, and while I still have my bad days, I have the support I need from my friends and family. I feel like my past is behind me and now I just live life as good as I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re struggling with your mental health, don't be afraid to talk to your friends, teachers, parents, guardians, whoever you trust about anything that is happening to you. Chances are, someone will support and help you through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you see someone who looks like they are having a bad day or they look a bit stressed, just ask them if they are okay, it could make a big difference to them. Don’t be afraid.\n",
      "Today, any of my friends would tell you that I am more than happy to talk about mental health openly and without shame. In fact, it's one of my favourite topics of conversation, and I think sometimes people might wish I would give it a rest. But I refuse to stop talking about it, because I know exactly how much impact a single conversation can have, and what it feels like to struggle alone in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the age of 15, I was studying for my GCSEs, like every other teenager in the country. I achieved well at school, lived in a wonderfully loving home with my parents and younger sister, and was surrounded by great friends. And then I became unwell. Depressed, anxious, and everything else that came with it. Suddenly, everything had changed, and each subsequent day felt increasingly torturous. Although, I believe people in my life suspected something was wrong, for a long time no one asked me what was going on in a way I felt able to answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking back, now aged 21, I can see that this was partly due to the fact I was terribly ashamed that I wasn't able to 'just get on with things' in the way I thought many of my peers did. I decided it was easier to say I was fine, than attempt to explain what I was feeling. After all, I had no idea what was really wrong, so how could I possibly explain it to someone else who doesn't really seem to have the time of day? One teacher demanded to know why my grades had dropped, and when I couldn't find the words, they told me I wasn't working hard enough; another told me they were sick of my excuses: they said it was \"disappointing\". And I wondered, if the adults in my life thought this, then what would my friends think? I heard words like 'mental', 'crazy', and 'psycho' being used in the most derogatory way in every day classroom chatter. So, I was silent, and this carried on for months.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was until a particularly wonderful teacher changed everything with a single conversation. She invited me into her office and asked me if there was anything I wanted to talk about, because I hadn't seemed quite myself. She told me there was no pressure to tell her anything, but I could talk if I wanted to and she was there to listen for as long as I needed. For the first time, I was able to tell another person about some of the thoughts, feelings and behaviours that I had been living with for months. It is hard to explain the feeling of having this weight lifted from your shoulders, but if you can imagine the relief you might feel when you catch a glimpse of a lighthouse after spending months lost in a storm at sea? Well, I don't imagine it's dissimilar to that.\n",
      "\n",
      "This conversation was the first step on the long journey of recovery, a journey I am still on now, and probably will be to some extent for the rest of my life. It was the first step towards having an honest conversation with my parents, going to see my GP, and getting referred to CAMHS where I was able to access a psychiatrist to get an accurate diagnosis and specialist treatment. This conversation was my beacon of light in the darkest of storms, and the person who started it saved my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a misconception that people shouldn't, or even can't, have conversations about mental health because they're not 'professionals', 'counsellors' or 'therapists', but this couldn't be further from the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "No qualifications are needed to offer a vulnerable person a safe space and time to talk. Often the most meaningful conversations are those in everyday life, where simply a listening ear is offered: over a cup of coffee with a friend, cooking dinner with a family member, or on a lunch break at work with a colleague. When you start having these conversations, you realise that usually no advice is needed or wanted, but rather the opportunity to chat without the fear of judgement.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're not sure how to start a conversation, I would volunteer the words offered to me by my amazing teacher: \"Is there anything you want to talk about? You haven't seemed quite yourself lately.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On Time to Talk Day 2019 (and every day after, of course!) I urge you to remember that one conversation can change a person's life, whether you realise it or not.\n",
      "So you’ve decided to have a conversation about mental health? That’s amazing! Whether you’re the person being brave enough to talk, or the one taking the time to listen, you’re doing a great thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve attempted to talk about my struggles with depression, anxiety and panic attacks more times than I can count, to varying degrees of success. I know there can be so much pressure and expectation surrounding this conversation and I’ve come to realise - through lots of trial and error - that four key things can help make this conversation as good as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first? COMFORT.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve talked about my mental health in many uncomfortable settings: in the deputy head’s office at school; around the dinner table with my parents; in a cramped, grey meeting room on campus. It doesn’t have to be this way! It’s crucial that everyone in the conversation feels physically and emotionally comfortable throughout, but keep in mind that different things work for different people. I like being in my own house so I’m in control and it’s a familiar, quiet environment. Others may like being in a more public yet still relaxed setting, like a coffee shop. Some may find comfort in holding the other person’s hand throughout the conversation, or being given the occasional hug, but others won’t want to be touched at all - perhaps start by laying out boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’d argue there’s one universal rule: if you’re the one listening to someone else’s experiences, please put your phone on silent and ideally keep it out of sight. I find that if someone’s phone keeps going off or they’re often looking towards it, my walls go up because I panic that they don’t really want to be talking to me, or would rather be elsewhere.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "The next key thing is TIME.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is vital. If someone is willing to talk to you about their mental health, you should be honoured that they feel comfortable enough with you to share what’s on their mind. But please don’t expect them to sum up their experiences in a five minute, well-rehearsed, easy-to-digest speech. There will be pauses, stuttering, muttering, tangents, tears - or even a good few minutes of silence whilst they work out how and where to begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, it’s really important this conversation takes place when all participants have a decent chunk of time to spare. It’s also a good idea to manage expectations from the start - by warning the person that you have, say, until 3pm to sit with them. This helps to avoid the risk of the person sharing their story feeling like a burden or a nuisance for taking up your time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let’s talk about REFRESHMENTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "What may sound trivial can actually be one of the most important ingredients in a good conversation. I’m always more open and expansive (and honest) with a mug of tea or coffee in front of me. I suppose this is partly because of the warmth a hot drink gives, making me feel instantly more comfortable (and as I’ve already outlined, comfort is key). But I also think just having something to do with your hands, and a secondary focus, can assist in easing nerves. Plus, taking a sip from your mug gives you a chance to pause, breathe, and really consider what you’d like to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, if you’re not a hot drink fan and you can’t be tempted by a biscuit, you could have something else nearby to fiddle with if necessary – a pen, a piece of jewellery or a soft toy are all good options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, consider your NEXT STEPS.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve listened to a friend or loved one talk about their mental health, you might be upset, or unsure what to feel - that’s understandable! Please remember that, although you’ve been someone’s confidant, you’re entitled to seek help yourself. Check in with how you’re feeling, and use the Time to Change website to find out how to seek support.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’ve just shared your experiences, it’s ok if you’re unsure what you want to happen next! Ask your loved one whether they’re happy to continue to be a listening ear, accompany you to future appointments etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither of you should make firm promises or resolutions - this could cause upset in future if they can’t be met. In one of my lowest moments, a friend suggested that from then on, we should think of ourselves as a team, facing everything together. I think this is a brilliant next step to take: agreeing that, whilst neither of you has immediate answers or solutions, you’re a team, picking up the slack for one another where necessary - because a problem shared really is a problem halved.\n",
      "A simple gesture, a simple ‘Hey, how are you?’ can make all the difference in someone’s day. Talking about how the world around you is closing in on you, how you feel alone, how it’s raining gasoline and you’re trying your hardest to resist the urge to set yourself on fire can be very very challenging to talk about especially if you’ve never had that space to talk about it before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having experienced anxiety and depression for a few years now myself, I know how self-debilitating it can get and feeling like you don’t have anyone to talk to. You’re afraid that if you let your guard down people will think that you’re weak, you don’t want to be vulnerable only to be left as a prisoner of your own mind, trapped with your demons, questioning your worth after giving away your secrets to people who you thought would be there forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s not always easy to ask someone about their mental health and don’t ask if you’re not prepared to listen and will brush it off. It’s so important that if you do ask you actually care and try to understand what the person is trying to say. It won’t necessarily always make sense to you but for the person going through a hard time, I can assure you that they’re grateful that somebody is expressing a concern in them, have the time of day for them and are willing to listen to them. A listening ear, love and reassurance can save someone, trust me.\n",
      "\n",
      "You don’t even have to jump straight into mental health all the time. Regularly checking up on someone, whether they’re eating/sleeping well, making time for them, encouraging them to do activities such as sports with you can help. Sports can be a good way of releasing emotion and stress, and tends to make you feel better afterwards (unless you lose a game lol).\n",
      "\n",
      "It doesn’t always have to be talk, the little things you do for someone struggling which you don’t even realise make all the difference. Just knowing you have someone who you can speak to anytime and every time gives you that sense of support and makes you realise that you’re not alone and that there’s always hope. There are people out there who care and are willing to help you. However, I urge those who invest their time trying to support someone to only do and say what they can and will do. Don’t give someone your all only to wake up one day and abandon them. The fact that you have switched up after creating a safe space for them where they could be themselves freely without being judged now accumulates to fear that you will reveal their secrets to someone else and possibly even betray them - that can well and truly emotionally destroy someone more than you can imagine, so please only do what you can and are willing to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being able to speak to someone can take a big load off your shoulders, you naturally start to feel lighter as if the thing weighing you down has been lifted simply because someone listened to you, it’s so important you ask twice! If someone is acting slightly different, why not start a conversation and ask them how things are going? Always try to be understanding and approach the situation with concern and care.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Be the reason someone believes in the goodness of people.\n",
      "Just before Christmas this year I began to have thoughts that weren't entirely to my liking. I put it down to the usual feelings I get around that time. They'll pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christmas came around, the thoughts were getting worse. The nagging thought that something isn't right. I was deeply unhappy. It was only Christmas Day afternoon that I found myself at peace. As a family we were all enjoying time together.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 27th of December I was back at work, this will help, I thought, the job keeps me busy and focused. Then the thumping heart beat would start. Anxiety? Why? Stupidly I ignored it. I began to feel sorry for myself, and it began to manifest in to something much darker.\n",
      "\n",
      "New year, new start. Yup pretty much, but not a new start I'd wish on anyone. Looking back now it all seems so clear. I was irritable, looking to pick fights, writing incendiary tweets to get the reaction I wanted. Bad vibes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The days passed and I became focused on finding a way out of my darkness. This is the bit I find hardest to write, but I feel it needs to be put out there, for people to understand it can happen, and something can be done to stop it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I began to Google ways to end my life. I began planning when would be the best time to do it. I knew it would destroy people's lives so what date would be the best to lessen the impact years down the line. My heart is thumping as I write this now. It's a matter of when, not if. I needed out, I couldn't see my life improving, or even staying the same. It was getting worse.\n",

      "Thankfully I slipped up, something totally unrelated to my own battles opened the flood gates. My reckless nature almost destroyed the woman I love. It all came rushing out. How I'd felt for weeks, how quickly those feelings developed, my worries and stresses, my plan to end it all. My wife was destroyed, she'd heard it before, other than attempting to take my own life. I couldn't do this to her over and over again, my brain was screaming \"get out, get out now, there's no way back\". Mrs G had other ideas, basically calling me an idiot. Putting others before my own mental health. Home truths. They hurt but everything was brought in to a very sharp focus. This woman would do anything for me. I needed to realise that. We talked, hugged, listened and laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "By talking I could suddenly see a future. I wasn't on my own. Rather than tumbling over a cliff, I was now hanging on, and in weeks to come, I can camber to safety. It's not a fairy tale. It isn't just a case of me talking and everything being fine. I'm still very capable of misinterpreting something and thinking the worst. It's learning that it's not the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "The support from people on Twitter, people I barely know, friends and colleagues has been overwhelming. It will be incredibly embarrassing meeting these people next time, but at least there will be a next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Struggling with mental illness can be very isolating, and the fear that brings with it will often lead to someone becoming closed off. Starting a conversation about mental illness will help 'normalise' those feelings. You begin to feel like someone is listening, that somebody cares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking is the most powerful treatment for mental illness, if gives you an outlet, it helps people understand and it lessens any stigma. Yes I struggle with pretty severe depression at times, but I also enjoy many of the things you do, don't alienate me, include me.\n",

      "Time to Talk Day is February 7th, I implore you to take the time to start a conversation about mental health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peace and thank you.\n",
      " You have bad days. Your car doesn’t start, you’re late to work, you miss a meeting – it’s a bad day. You just want to get home, put your feet up and write it off because tomorrow is a fresh start – an opportunity to reset your mind and put yesterday down to “just one of those days.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Tomorrow you get to work on time, you go into a meeting and give an outstanding performance, your boss pulls you to one side and talks about a possible promotion. You text your partner who wants to take you for a celebratory dinner. You show up to the restaurant and he’s there with flowers and a ring – he proposes to you. Your day could not have gone better. But you go home, and you cry yourself to sleep. You wake up feeling empty. You feel heartbreakingly sad and you have no idea why. You convince yourself he doesn’t know you, because if he did, he would never want to marry you. If people at work knew what you were really like, they wouldn’t promote you. They would fire you. \n",
      "\n",
      "They would fire you, because you are worthless. He would leave you because you are fundamentally unlovable. But to the outside eye, your life could not be more perfect, and there is no logical reason why you shouldn’t be ecstatic. At your engagement party you fake a smile and tell everyone how incandescently happy you are, but it is all a lie. You smile because you should. You tell people you are happy because that is how you should feel. But you don’t. There is a gaping sadness in you, which is there for no reason at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "And no one can see it, so maybe it’s just you. Maybe something’s wrong with you. What possible reason do you have to be sad? And you feel ashamed. So you don’t say anything to anyone. Because when you have in the past, they’ve said – “What reason do you have to be sad?” “You should be grateful, some people have it much worse.” “You don’t look like you’re depressed.” “Everyone has a bad day, you’re just overreacting.” So you stay silent. You internalise the struggle. You fight it alone.  \n",
      "\n",
      "How do you explain something you don’t understand? How do you tell people how you feel when you don’t feel anything? And when you do feel, it is an onslaught of self-loathing and unparalleled sadness. \n",
      "\n",
      "You go into work the next day, and you don’t have the energy to lie. You don’t have the energy to pretend to be okay. So you excuse yourself and you go to the bathroom. You make sure no one else is in there, you lock yourself in a stall and collapse onto the floor, crying uncontrollably. You struggle to catch your breath and you panic because you cannot get enough oxygen to your lungs. You cry more. You panic more. You start to remember every bad thing that’s happened in your life, every negative comment, every failed relationship, every single thing that happened which is all your fault. You cry until your facial muscles cramp, until you can catch your breath long enough to remember where you are. \n",
      "\n",
      "And you sometimes even calm yourself down by telling yourself it won’t last forever, that you can make it all end. You pick yourself up off the floor, readjust your clothes, wipe your tears and open the door. And someone is standing there. Someone is standing there looking at you. But they are looking at you with compassion and understanding. They are looking at you because even though they don’t understand what you feel, they understand that you are in a lot of pain, and you cannot see a way out. That you are struggling. So they step forward, place their hands in yours, and ask for your story. \n",
      "\n",
      "I look up at them, fresh tears in my eyes. I prepare to confess. I prepare to hear the same responses that I have heard since I was 15 years old. But I take a deep breath and tell her. I tell her and I close my eyes. Waiting for the disappointment. But she says nothing. I look at her and she’s crying. And she tells me that she believes me. The weight lifts off my chest. The guilt and the shame I had been carrying around for 10 years had almost gone. Because I knew there was something wrong with me, and she believed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We go for a drink, and she asks me when this all began. We sit for hours. She asks me how I feel. She cares. She gives me her number and tells me to contact her when I need to talk to someone. It is a lifeline. It is renewed hope that with the help of someone else, I can be better than this. I can live a better life than this. I can overcome this. And it all started when she placed her hands in mine. \n",
      "Sometimes, a little push is needed to get the ball rolling. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the fear of being perceived as nosy or intrusive it’s important to remember that when it comes to mental health, checking in with someone reminds them they aren’t alone when they’ve gone quiet. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the summer of 2018 I found myself struggling with depression more than ever before. Work became increasingly difficult to show up to, I feared confiding in anyone about my mental health because I saw myself as a burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt like I’d be draining to listen to, not worthy of being cared about. With my self-esteem at rock bottom, I couldn’t even begin to appreciate the empathy of others. \n",
      "\n",
      "Depression had completely changed my life.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All my friends were enjoying the long bright days, maximising the warm weekends, going on adventures, getting engaged, and house hunting whilst I became increasingly isolated, on the outside looking in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Days passed wishing someone could see me and my pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to talk about how much I was struggling but didn’t know how. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feared scaring others, it became excruciatingly routine to just ignore the phone.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Depression became my world, I couldn’t imagine anyone else wanting to see inside so I pushed everyone away. I didn’t want to drag them into my own turmoil. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’d experienced periods of low mood but depression in its entirety overwhelmed me, I felt trapped in my loneliness, convinced that no one wanted to hear the truth about how I was really feeling when they asked. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was easier to shut people out in and outside of the home with the classic “I’m fine” when in truth I was falling apart, bereft with the fatigue of life becoming progressively joyless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inside I knew that if a friend was having a tough time, I’d want to know how they were really doing just so they knew they had a friend on the other side of the walls around them. I’d never been in the habit of giving up on people but struggled not to give up on myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’d spent my life giving my time, energy, love, and patience to others yet couldn’t imagine getting back in return. \n",
      "\n",
      "I didn’t know how to accept help because I couldn’t believe I was worthy of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Weeks of avoiding social contact had passed, and a colleague turned close friend reached out again. She wanted to see me, catch up and see how I was, we’d formed a really close bond at work, and though my walls were still up I let her in. \n",
      "\n",
      "She thankfully wasn’t buying it when I said I was “fine”. \n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that she was persistent with communication despite me being consistently unresponsive pushed me to realise hearing from her really added to my willingness to at least try and open up. \n",
      "\n",
      "It reminded me that I had a real friend out there, that I was cared about. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the walls depression encouraged me to put up, I’d learned it’s okay to take a few bricks down and talk to the person on the other side. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’d been sat over dinner talking about work, summer plans, and books we’d shared an interest in. I mentioned not having read much recently because I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Then came the dreaded question.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, how are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat there speechless, eventually telling her I couldn’t answer that. \n",
      "\n",
      "It felt like a loaded question. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a society we’ve become accustomed to seeing conversations about negative thoughts and feelings as something to be ashamed of yet talking about having the flu is seen as normal.  \n",
      "\n",
      "“Seriously, just say whatever comes to mind. I want to know how you’re feeling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That push right there, her asking me for a second time led to me opening up about feeling low, desperately unhappy, and not enjoying life. \n",
      "\n",
      "It steered to me explain why I struggled to keep up with reading, about leaving my job I’d been away from on sick leave for a while, and what I’d like to move on to. I didn’t feel like I had to filter what I was saying so it all just came out; the dam of pent up emotion had burst its banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "She never judged me, only listened. \n",
      "\n",
      "We didn’t spend the whole evening talking about my mental health, we just talked. \n",
      "\n",
      "The #AskTwice campaign is the push I wish I’d had years ago when I started to struggle with my mental health. It opened my eyes to really think about all the times I’ve said I was fine when I wasn’t, and when others around me have done the same. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are misconceptions about how to talk to someone with a mental health problem, but the truth is you don’t need to be a mental health expert, or try to “fix” someone, the only thing needed is your willingness to listen, empathy, and an open mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "A friend with a mental health problem is still a friend, a life with mental health problems is still a life. #AskTwice to remind someone that they aren’t invisible, and that they will be heard. \n",
      "As someone who has been combatting mental illness for many years, I felt it was important to share this. I have suffered two major depressions in my life and also struggled with three different eating disorders. I know what it means when your mind takes control of every thought and distorts every single one into something upsetting, disturbing and self-destructive. I can honestly feel my head warp internal mind processes into an infernal torture where it seems impossible to go forward in life. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have professional help and it is the one thing that is helping me face my darkest side. I know I'm not ok sometimes and I can't seem to help those around me understand. They say, “Be happy, you have everything!” but they have no idea what goes on inside my mind every day. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are days I can't get out of bed, where I could sleep for hours on end, where I feel like doing nothing, since nothing at all makes it better or go away. It's always there, my mind, full\n",
      "of auto-criticism letting me know I'll never be good enough in my business, in my relationships, in my personal achievements. It lets me know I'm worthless, useless, forever below the expectations of society, friends, family and most of all below the expectations I have of myself. \n",
      "\n",
      "It honestly does not matter what is going on around me. I have people ask me where I am, where I was, because I certainly wasn't present with them at that moment. I have exercised to the point of almost losing consciousness, I've binged on food to fill the emptiness, I have tried to starve myself to make it all stop, I have wanted to leave this world and free myself from the constant torture of my thoughts. \n",
      "\n",
      "If I ever try to share any of this I get very little understanding, as if I have invented these problems, that it is me that can control these thoughts, that I do it on purpose, that I'm trying to get attention, that I have “rich people problems”. As though this isn't an acceptable part of me to show because I am meant to be a strong, beautiful and successful business woman who has to be first and foremost a partner, a lover, a friend, a daughter, a boss. This is who they want to see and who they want me to be always. \n",
      "\n",
      "And that is simply exhausting. Can we not accept that we are flawed, have more compassion, let people who are suffering from mental illness know that even if we don't understand, that we are there by their side, even in their worst moments. Just by being there and accepting our weaknesses, that we don't want to change the \"mind\" of mental illness by \"snapping\" out of it or by \"being happy\". Accept that negative emotions and thoughts are part of us, that it's ok for them to be there and to love us even if we are mentally ill, just as you would love and care for someone with a broken arm. \n",
      "\n",
      "Help someone with mental illness as you would someone with any illness, with compassion, love, care and closeness and help them get professional help, encourage them to share their problems even if it is hard to hear the darkest parts of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one would hesitate to see a doctor about a physical illness or injury, so why is there still so much shame around getting psychological help for mental illness?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have people ask me why I talk to a psychologist as if they know what is best for me and that I shouldn't need help for my mind, only weak or crazy people need that. We all need to wake up and make an effort to be more understanding, accepting and compassionate to those that suffer from mental illness. Only in this way can we help reduce suicide and offer other ways out.\n",
      "Next time you hear someone say how far we’ve come in the fight against mental health, take a moment to consider that statement. 1 in 4 people suffer from mental illness in the UK – around 15 million people. That’s potentially 1 in 4 people you know - one of your close friends, a family member, or a colleague sitting at the desk next to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But most of those people suffer largely in silence. Recent global studies estimate up to a third of people with depression receive no support or treatment at all. Why? Because despite what you may read in the media, there is still a massive stigma attached to mental illness. A stigma that prevents many from telling even their nearest and dearest, crippled by an overwhelming cocktail of shame, failure, inadequacy and hopelessness. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most sufferers of depression will have an experience involving a bad reaction, of some well-meant advice that had the inverse effect. Filed under “What not to say to someone with depression”. Pull yourself together. Snap out of it. Stop feeling sorry for yourself.  What have you got to be unhappy about? Reactions that show while we may be talking more about mental illness, increased exposure doesn’t necessarily equate to a greater understanding of the condition.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The fear of stigma is even more heightened in the workplace. If colleagues knew your secret surely they’d think differently about you, possibly questioning your reliability or your judgement. At best, they may just feel uncomfortable around you, not knowing what to say or how to say it.  At worst, they’ll doubt your ability to do the job. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All this means, for sufferers, divulging mental illness at work is a complex issue – a legal and moral dilemma I faced myself earlier this year, when I started a new job. The industry or sector is not important, because what happened next could have happened in many institutions or workplaces across the country. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On being told I’d got the job, I was invited in for an unofficial meeting to get to know my new colleagues and discuss schedules for upcoming projects. The department consisted of 12-15 people, all of whom seemed amicable, relaxed and funny. I could happily see myself working with these people and felt confident about my new role. That positive first impression lasted of all of five minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As the meeting progressed, the head of the department announced that a date had been set for a mandatory training session about mental health in the work place.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Cue a collective groan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With mock seriousness, the head of department noted that this was an important session, in light of what happened earlier in the year to Steve. For my benefit, she explained that Steve was a previous member of staff who had suffered “a mental breakdown” at work.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Exchanged glances. Uncomfortable shifting in seats. Stifled laughter. \n",
      " \n",
      "I’d like to say it was one or two, and that it was frowned upon by the others, or swiftly shut down by the team leader, but that’s not what happened. Everyone involved in that meeting was in on the joke, some accessories only through a silent smirk, others outwardly laughing at Steve’s expense.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The general tone was implicit. Steve couldn’t cut it. Steve wasn’t tough enough. No-one said it. No-one had to.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One or two even voiced annoyance at having to give up their time to attend this awareness session, like the people who complain about rail delays when some desperate soul has jumped in front of a speeding train.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And me? Well I was focusing hard to disguise the fact that my cheeks were blanching, and my throat tightening – the tell-tale signs of anxiety that would give my secret away. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Because I’m like Steve. Sometimes I struggle to keep things together. And as a long-term sufferer of depression, I was experiencing that all too common sinking feeling, triggered by the realisation that this was not going to be a healthy environment for me to work in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Attitudes like this are exactly why people are scared to confide in colleagues about their condition, myself included. In my working life, I’ve told perhaps 2 or 3 people about this illness since I was first diagnosed 9 years ago. I don’t want to be judged, treated differently, ridiculed or to make others feel uncomfortable in my presence.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, I choose to hide it. And I’ve been hiding it for so long, I’ve become an expert at concealing it from others. Although officially diagnosed at 34, with hindsight I now understand that I developed the condition in childhood, experiencing my first suicidal thoughts as early as 12 years of age. That’s over 30 years of hiding, pretending and lying. It’s become a part of who I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the following month between that meeting and my first day in the new role, I could feel the dark clouds gathering. While I tried to fool myself and everyone else around me, I knew that I couldn’t work in an environment where people had such an obvious lack of respect and compassion for others suffering with mental health problems. They were laughing at Steve, but in a few months’ time they could be laughing about me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As friends and family wished me luck, I did what I do best – I put my gut instinct to one side and pretended everything was going to be ok. I went in for my first day, going through the motions in a robotic trance. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my first tasks was to complete mandatory HR forms. A formality for most.  Name, address, National Insurance number. Then the medical declaration form. A small tick box.  Asking me to declare any prior mental health conditions. Flashback to that room full of colleagues laughing. Would you tick it?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I somehow got through the day, suppressing my emotions for later. When the inevitable breakdown happened on the drive home, it marked the release of a month of anxiety, worry and despair. I parked my car in a country lane, unable to face home, contemplating suicide. A frantic mess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But I’m lucky. When things get tough, I have the support of those who love me. Soon my phone was vibrating with texts and calls. My wife first. Come home. Let’s talk. We need you.  A close friend. You are loved and valued. My father. We’ll get through this together. Whatever you need.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And once the storm subsided, I did the only thing I could do for the sake of my health and well-being. I pressed send on my resignation email after just one day in the job. I didn’t mention the team meeting to HR. I wasn’t looking to lodge complaints and get others in trouble. This was about self-preservation.\n",
      " \n",
      "No-one is harder on a manic depressive than they are on themselves. Quitting as I did was another self-perceived failure that had to be explained away. There followed a string of excuses to friends, lies dressed up to help me salvage some dignity. The position wasn’t what I thought. Contractual issues. Anything other than the truth. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole episode triggered a complete relapse of my depression, which my GP informed me should now be considered a lifelong condition, requiring long-term medication. I was then signed off work for 4 weeks, from a job that no longer existed. “Do you need a letter?” – “No, I think I’ll be ok.” \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the next time you hear someone say how far we’ve come, and how much perceptions of mental health have changed, ask yourself this. Would you feel comfortable telling your boss or work colleagues that you suffer from depression? Hearing those colleagues talking about Steve, I know I will certainly always think twice before opening up in future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And if by chance, you’re sitting next to a colleague who has divulged a mental health condition, instead of looking at him or her as the weak link in the team, consider what strength and bravery it took for them to share that information.\n",
      "I don’t think depression can be summed up in one image. I think at times it’s a lot of images. I spent some time with my niece a few days after I had felt the lowest I have ever felt. My nieces and nephew mean the world to me. They remind me of the simple joys in life. I had just taken my niece to the park and she was so happy just sitting in a swing and it made me think “Why can’t everyone just feel that happy all the time?”. They make me want to fight for my life, so I can watch them grow up and be the best aunty I can be for them. \n",
      "\n",
      "I find it hard to explain to someone who hasn’t had mental health problems what depression feels like. It’s so many different feelings all at once, yet you feel nothing at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had anxiety and PTSD (Post traumatic stress disorder) in the past which I found I could hide from people more easily. Depression crept up slowly and completely wiped me out. It was my counsellor who first mentioned depression to me. Hearing it out loud hurt, but I needed the wakeup call. Looking back, I am glad it was her that noticed first. She has supported me ever since.\n",
      "\n",
      "Admitting you have depression is such a massive step. It took me far too long to admit to family and friends that I was struggling. I felt ashamed and weak. I thought I could fight it alone, but the truth is you need their support more than ever when you aren’t coping. My family were starting to notice I was getting quieter and had lost my spark, yet I still pretended like everything was ok and tried my hardest to carry on as normal which eventually broke me. Don’t get me wrong, I have supportive family and friends, but I really struggle to talk to people about my feelings. It makes you feel so alone and such a burden on people even though they want to be there for you. It’s wanting to be around the people who love you, but also wanting to lock yourself in the house and cry alone. It’s having no energy to even get out of bed, but you have to get up and go to work, faking a smile to get through the day. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was blind to how depression can also affect the people that love and care about me. When you are in a dark place you might think people don’t care about you, but this isn’t necessarily the case. My family told me they feel helpless and don’t know what to do to make me feel better, but small things like just spending time with me, going for a walk and chat or just giving me a hug is enough to make me feel more human. You need to let people take care of you when you are down. It will make them feel better and having someone there to make you a cup of tea or something to eat can make you feel better too. When I did tell my family I was depressed, it was a small relief to no longer need to fake how I was feeling in front of them. I slowly started to see that I needed to accept help.    \n",
      "\n",
      "There is such a negative stigma surrounding mental health and that’s what I was most afraid of; people judging me and not understanding what I was feeling. Some people see mental health problems as attention seeking or a sign of weakness, which is why so many people choose to hide them. I feel frustrated that mental health is not talked about enough today. \n",
      "\n",
      "The way I see the journey of recovery is like a tree, leaves may fall and weather may rock a tree but the roots remain and new leaves will always bloom. My leaves and branches may have fallen, but I have amazing people in my life that will help me to grow and keep me rooted and I am thankful to them for being there for me when I needed them most. I have good days and bad days, but I now know I am stronger than my black dog and I will keep fighting for myself and for the amazing people around me!  \n"

       " 'I’d be asked what triggered me to feel ‘sad’, and I felt so humiliated that I didn’t have a ‘trigger’; depression hits you when you least expect it, and it comes in frequent waves.',\n",
       " 'As well as being physically fatigued, my depression led to paranoia, which had a huge impact on my life, causing me to fret and become severely overwhelmed, and so, the cycle continued between being paranoid, which made me panic, which made me depressed.',\n",
       " \"I wish I had been told that depression isn't something to be ashamed of, as telling people I had depression was a task I still struggle to achieve.\",\n",

       " 'Depression pushed so many people out of my life to the point where I feared forming friendships, because the pain of losing the people I loved was too much to bear.',\n",
       " 'It was important that my friends would embrace my depression rather than see it as a flaw of mine, so I began openly talking about it to those around me, and by raising awareness, quite a few of my friends stepped forward to say they had been through the same, or at least knew somebody who did.',\n",
       " \"By accepting my depression and openly discussing it with others, I didn't feel as ashamed anymore.\",\n",

       " \"Men are usually surrounded by toxic masculine stereotypes, e.g always being told to ' man up ' which shouldn't be the case - and this is why men find it so hard to open up about their problems whether it be mental health, illnesses, financial problems or addictions.\",\n",
       " \"I personally haven't experienced anybody telling me to 'man up' or 'grow some balls' - fortunately I've been brought up around family and friends who have always told me the best way to get through your troubles is to openly speak out, whether that be to a professional or to a family member or friend.\",\n",

       "['There’s a constant battle in my head between whether I can push through another day. 5 years ago I made a decision that has caused a tsunami in my life. I won’t get into detail about it but long story short when I decided to tell my friends and family about it you could see the disappointment shining on their faces. It was so noticeable, i will compare it to a flash light directly in your face. It couldn’t go unnoticed. It was blinding. It crushed me. I was always taught as a kid that family is everything, family doesn’t turn their back and family doesn’t judge one another. Well that day changed it all. Never in my life have I felt so small. Everyone’s views and opinions about me changed. From that day on I’ve tried to do all I can to never disappoint anyone again. I started to suppress my feelings. I became anti social. I used to be bold and outgoing, now I am reserved and an introvert. I work my butt off but yet feel exhausted all at the same time. Im not eating properly and I know I should be. Everyday, whether it be at work, home, or in my relationship I feel as if I’m walking on egg shells to make everyone else feel better yet I’m drowning myself in my own chaos. Everyone speaks over me or just tunes me out all together so there are days where I won’t speak a single word. What is the point in opening my mouth when I’m not being heard. What is the point of doing all these things to make sure I don’t disappoint anyone again, when in reality at the end of the day I still feel just as bad or even worse. I find no enjoyment in anything anymore. I have no hobbies. I have no interests. I don’t even enjoy working. I just wanna come home and sleep. I can’t get organized, I’m to emotional, I’m to much of a downer. I have no friends. I mean I have my boyfriend and his friends say their my friends but they’re not. In reality they are there for him and not me. I just feel that sometimes i would be better off gone because I wouldn’t be able to disappoint like that again. I know there is beauty in life. I know there’s enjoyment for everyone out there. It’s just unfortunately, I’m not there.',\n",
       " 'I like beer but I don\\'t drink when my depression kicks in. I usually drink when I associate it for a good time.  But today, I\\'m tired of hearing my own pessimistic thoughts. So,  4 Heineken\\'s in and a \"feel good show\"  I just found (Community), and I\\'m feeling better but not cured.  Found this sub last month and when I feel down I like to look in and see who I can relate to, and damn, I sure have so much in common with you guys(numbness). I\\'ll be honest, anything you do or say cannot make me feel better because the pain is so deep in me, but reading some of these posts make me say, Amen!  \\n\\nSchool work is my enemy. 8 years in the Army and I\\'ve had enough, and I just want to have skills good enough to earn a good enough pay outside the Army, instead of taking it from behind by the green weenie. Since this quarantine, I\\'ve been trying so hard to work on my degree (that I\\'ve been off and on since the past 12 years (associates)) that I get so damn depressed every time I try and I reject everyone I love, away from me that wants to help. I want help , but if I love you then I will reject you. I\\'ve been prescribed Concerta and it helps a little, but when I don\\'t understand something, I throw myself a pity party. I compare myself to others, but how can I not? I can barely do one class a semester without losing mind. Online school, I can\\'t get enough help. Onsite school, the teacher is going so fast that I\\'m so far behind it would be an embarrassment to ask if they could start from the beginning. I feel retarded compared to others. I wouldn\\'t be surprised if one day my wife will leave me. I understand SO\\'s are affected so much by this and I wish I could magically tell myself to stop feeling this way because I love my wife and son so much. I know the next day I will wake up and tell myself, WTF were you acting like that(as if I woke up from a hangover), and it\\'s a new beginning(crossing my fingers I don\\'t get triggered by schoolwork or my own thoughts in general). And I have thought about suicide. The farthest I can get to is the thought of it, because, how do people even go through with it? I remember the first time being depressed, I had a dream that I was happy to go to heaven (and I was in 4th grade). I was so stressed from school that I did not mind if God just pulled the plug. I always asked my Mother for help from school and she was the most patient with me regardless of her being depressed (which I just found out not too long ago.). If I asked my Dad for help, he\\'d just tell me I was doing everything wrong and have me rewrite the whole damn paper because there was too much eraser marks on the worksheet or he\\'d just beat me for asking him because it was a last minute assignment. I\\'m so intrigued by learning, but when you cannot fully access your full potential, especially when you witness yourself struggling in front of others who understand the concept, it really hurts, so fucking bad.\\n\\nThank you for listening.',\n",

As long as you treat well to everyone and especially to yourself. You need not to worry about anything else. It is tiring. It is dreading. Damn, it is depressing. I think the key is just to hang on. Let this wave pass. It may feel like it's taking too long, because it is but that's just it. It's never up to us. Only how we decide to react to this. We can whine, cry and break down but we don't give up. What more is there? How would we know if we dont keep going. Is there even something on the horizon. What is there to look forward to if life itself tortures you. Sometimes you just also wake up feeling great and your gut is telling you this day will be fantastic.

All of this kinda starts with my dad leaving ehen i was about 5 or 6. I wish he wouldve just left me forever ya know but he keeps coming back. Now i know that that may seem like stupid but hear me out. When the guy who is supposed to be there for you just comes to remind you that he leaves every single time. He just comes and makes empty promises that get my hopes up like the idot that i am. The thing is that my dad is a dreamer and my mom is a realist whos mom was a bitch. My grandma was a bitch to my mom when growing up and the thing that fucks with me is that if you knew you grew up with some fucked up mom maybe try to better yourself and BE BETTER FOR YOUR OWN CHILD. Also a couple of months ago ky mom admitted to have postpartum depression and that she tried to choke me several times. And she has said that its been very hard for heem now i get it i really do. But she makes it out that raising me was a chore. She always says that she had to raise me on her own. Ever since i have known my mother she has been a workaholic. I would take care of myself and there were times where my aunt or grandma would take care of me. She uses the excuse is to tale care of bills but she blames and i cant find the word for it but basically she blames me for needing food and clothes and a roof under my head. I NEVER ask for expensive tjings or be brat or things liek taht and it bothers the hell out of me that she tells everyone one lies about me and how much of a disgrace i am. I have always felt alone and school was like my home which meant that i did very good and got good grades. She wanted me to study here and save money and things like that but i actually applied to a very good school despite my grades dropping over the years. My grandma her mom would favor me out of her gandkids and giving me money saying im the only one without a dad. Now my father jesus Christ .he come sin thinking he can be a father without doing any of the raising . he is a business thag i rather not mention and just drops a coulple of bucks and thinks he has earned father of the yera. Also im an only child so you can see how alone i really an. Also my family thinks im a weirdo for not following mexican or hispanic traditions like political views and all of that. Also my other grandma didnt really liked me bc she thought the only reason my mom and dad martied is bc my mom was preggo ( which seems plausible)  So i kind of set the foundation that my family and i dont really get along (only sometomes my motjers motjer. Alsi if my writing and grammar is shitty its bc its 1:30 am and i have calmed down from cryong. Also i was sexually harrased at age 10 and that just traumatised me and i shoved that memory waaaayy down. shit got worse  when my dad went ro prison when i was starting middle school. My mom had kept it a secret but i foudn out by getting the mail for my dads mom. I dont like saying i have depression or that im depressed bc i never have been diagnosed or even told any doctor of how ive been feeling bc my family doesnt believe in mental illness. After knowing my dad was in jail i became very sad. It got to the point where i self harmed like for 4 years maybe more i honestly dont know when i stopped. As i said before i used to get good grades but once my dad got out if jail it got a got worse. I was getting a but dumb but a dummy with 80s\\n Then my grandma ( moms mom) got cancer. She was really the only one who showed a bit of love to me. She had to be put on hospice bc she was on the last stage. Im sorry if i get this wrong my mom wouldng tell me anything so im not an expert in that. And then out childhood home in mex burned down and then my other grandmother got sick and my dad had just left me again. And everything seemed out of place. I felt like god was just fucking with me and then my grandma ( moms mom) passed away in 2018 during the summer and i was there when her nurse told us she had a few hours left. When she did pass away i couldnt even look at her. Since then my mom has reached her max at being a bitch. Ans she knows it. She says that god loves her so it doesng matter. After that we moved to a smaller apartment during my jr year and long story short i won at a competition and had to go to state in feb of 2019. So im eating tacos with my mom and we get a ohone call that my other grandma had passed away. Only a few montjs apary both of ny grandmas passed away and i couldn't decipher what my emotions were. I didng go to ger sevice bc i was at state competition . my dad didnt even call me or anythinga nd i had told that to one of the teaxhers that went and said that maybe he was grieving ??? The problem woth that is that he acted like botjing happend so my tecaher was wrong. Thats when my spiraling began . i woudl just cry and cry and couldnt think of anything and my brain felt fuzzy and i felt suicidal and i told my mom and ahe said that i needed to snap out of it and ask god to take that away form me. ??? Like how do you expect me to ask the guy who just did all of that to me. Anyways by the end of jr yeat and now my mom and i have been fighting. And it paralyzes me . idk how ro respond which just leaves me to have ti go tjrough the screamim3 and being told that im noy good enough and that im amking shit uo. Then i became a bit of financially independent she just gave me shit fir anything. And when i got accepted to the uni that i apolied for she said she didnt think that i woulve gotten in. I just have never gelt safe loved and secure . and i want that so bad. The last two arguements we had she told me that she was done with me and that she xant wait for me to leave . and that shes done woth me in geberal. That im ungrateful and all of these nasty thibgs. And while all of that happened i was a memebe and vice president of my class, in pwoerlifting, nhs, tafe ( another club) and worked a job. And yet i am worthless and lazy and whatever i feel is invalid. I just give uo. Growing uo i didnt think i would live past 18 and i still dont. I really dont see a future and with recent ecents it just fuels my bad emotions and all i wanna do is sleep. I havent fi ished documebts for that college and i havent done a weeks woth of work so my school bc i see no point since we are graduating online.

Pretty similar to me. \\n\\nThe other night, my sister, who is currently 18, got drunk whilst on a video chat to a few of her friends. The aftermath, which I slept through, was apparently horrible. My sister claimed that my parents are responsible for her weight, she claims my parents only give me attention and her none, she claims I’m always picking on her, even though she’s usually the one who picks on me, she thinks my parents don’t care etc. \\nMy mother struggled horribly with my sister saying these things and has pretty much been in bed the whole day now.

       " 'I (19F) began university last year February- in another province/ state. Having being a \"quote on quote loser\" in high school, I was concerned about my university social life. I imagined finding closeness with members of my class but this was not the case. \\n\\nOn the last day of our orientation week, I was acquainted to a male, we shall call Yang (21M). I knew he was trouble- my kind of trouble- the minute I lay my eyes on him. Believe me- I know how cliche this sounds- just hold on there.\\n\\nSince we were living at the same residence- everything moved at a ,somewhat, fast pace. As the days passed by- the connection between Yang and I grew exponentially. We allowed ourselves to get carried away- in the most beautiful way. Although we struggled to communicate effectively and express our concerns regarding our relationship- things were moving along steadily.\\n\\nUntill- I got a little too drunk, a little too insecure and very irrational. In an attempt to win Yang\\'s attention: I attempted to sleep with 2 of his close friends (not simultaneously). (According to my knowledge- I was not intimate with either of them, but I made an ATTEMPT to be. However, one of Yang\\'s friends said otherwise to Yang- then later wanted to withdraw his statement.) After this incident- Yang deleted and blocked my number and we split ways.\\n\\nA week later a rumor emerged. People began twisting the story and said I was raped. When Yang heard this he rushed over to make sure I was okay. I explained to him (and then later everyone else) exactly what I remember happened - but not my immature reasoning behind it all. He went on to explain that the event made him realize his much he cared about me- and that we should try start over, do we did.\\n\\nThroughout our relationship- Yang always seemed to be on the fence. He was never comfortable with public displays of affection yet he would cling to me when we where alone. We never had titles. We would ooscillate between friends with benefits and \"situationship\" often - so there was always confusion. \\n\\nConfusion was the biggest- among many others- issue we had. We constantly struggled to communicate effectively- but always seemed to find a way to stay together- most of the time it was just sex.\\n\\nSex played a big part in our relationship and I didnt like that. Yang knew that he was the first and only person I had slept with- he thought of it as \"special\". Being as immature as I was- I wanted to prove to myself that my love for him was not dependent on this \"special\" little fact. I cheated on him repeatedly and justified it- every single time. In fact I used it to fuel my love for him. I would constantly think about him while I was with someone else and that somehow made me think it was okay. \\n\\nWith Yang- sex was soulful. A big part of me felt like we were genuinely making love and I though that could sustain us. But as soon as my doubts became too much for him, instead of reassuring me- in the way he certainly knew I needed him to-things ended and we became friends with benefits. \\n\\nHe said he felt as though he was loosing himself when he was with me. He said he was struggling to \"get over the insecurities he had built up with his ex\". I honestly blame myself for not communicating better, for not saying that we could work through EVERYTHING ,because I genuinely adored and loved him.\\n\\nBy this time it was only June and I wasnt ready to give up on dating. I made an effort to meet new people - and I did. Some promised me the world- but just for the night. Some turn into friends. But they all reminded me why I loved Yang- so I stopped searching for \"someone new\".\\n\\nWhen I spoke about my encounters with Yang- he would get upset. Regardless of the fact that we were friends with benefits, he would get jealous. This encouraged me to \"stay off the market\" and loyal to him. \\n\\nWhen September came around- I fell pregnant. When I told Yang- he adamantly insisted I have an abortion. However, I expressed my religious and personal views on the subject- and he finally agreed that it was my decision to make. (He added that he wouldnt be a present father if I decided to carry the pregnancy through.)\\n\\nTragically, I miscarried late October. I had a terrible break down- after having too much wine- one evening. Coincidentally, Yang was out drinking with his friends- but lied and said he was with his sister. My roommate walked in on me- during my cutting episode - and in a panic called Yang. Because I was intoxicated - I dont remember when Yang arrived to the scene but I remember that he cleaned my cuts and put me to sleep. I just remember him being very calm- maybe because he knew I had been cutting weeks before the break down. \\n\\nA few days later, Yang had a panic attack and was rushed to hospital. He said he had been very worried about me and felt hopeless. It broke my heart when he said that. I never wanted to cause him such trauma but I did.\\n\\nDuring this time we were also writing finals and wanted to get our minds off everything. We baked, cooked, smoked weed and had a lot of fun with eachother. For a while- we were getting along perfectly and if felt like we were really a couple. Regardless-I never thought this time meant much to him. I hated the fact that I felt so unjustified in loving him, but I realised that I couldn\\'t necessarily control the way he portrayed himself and his emotions. \\n\\nBy the end of the year we were officially together and wanted to keep thinks going through the holiday apart. We argued about misunderstanding eachother, jealousy, insecurities and everything in between. However- there were still times I really felt at home with him. We knew that our arguments were fueled by social media and couldnt wait for the new year to begin so we could figure out our new relationship schedule and talk out any issues- face to face- as per usual. \\n\\nBefore we had the chance to do this- he ended things. In his eyes the bad outweighed the good and he didnt want to hurt me any longer- or waste my time. I understood that we had been toxic for eachother but we were supposed to change that when the new year began.\\n\\nWhen we broke up - Yang requested that we pretended we were strangers. We walked past eachother -between lectures- many times, but said nothing. It broke my heart to know that I could be thrown away so easily... but I still love him.\\n\\nIt\\'s been 3 months since the break up- not long, yes- but I feel like I will forever be consumed and affected by him. He is the subject of my poetry, dreams and daily thoughts. I\\'ve deleted his contact details and unfollow him from social media- as per his request- but I cant help but find myself crying at 2am because I saw a girl in his feed.\\n\\nA few weeks back- Yang texted me. He wanted to be friends- but I declined. I explained that it would break my heart to hear or see him with someone new- someone that was everything I couldnt be. We havent spoken since- he ignored my (only funny to me) \"3am horny hour\" text.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve made it to the end of this post- I\\'m sure you\\'re wondering why I\\'m telling this story... I need advice. What do I do? Jump back into the dating pool? Find a f- buddy? Stay single and tough it out? \\n\\nI crave emotional and physical intimacy- to the point of crying -somedays. At my core- I believe I am engineered to seek and find fulfill in all forms of intimacy- but I no longer feel safe in trusting myself, desires and decisions regarding my desires. \\n\\nThank you in advance and I apologize for any typing errors made.',\n",

I can name every friend group I’ve been in since kindergarten, which equates to a different group of people each year. I’ve never had a best friend. Just the girl I talk to daily. I’ve grown up physically, sexually, and emotionally abused. I don’t like talking out my issues because I feel as if I’m an attention whore.

Of course, but I wouldn’t be hurt more than I’ve already been hurt. But then again, what do I have to gain from this? Completely nothing. \\n\\nI separate myself from every person possible because I’m so paranoid of being used again. My final group former “friends” would make plans, ditch me last minute, and post pictures of all the good times they had together. My parents have disowned me for a long while, and I pay for my own groceries, cook my own dinners, buy my own clothes, and try desperately to avoid them when they drink. I’ve had to sleep in my car some nights, which caused me to fail a class. I’m only sixteen. If I actually have the privilege of sleeping at home, it’s like having roommates & not family. We never talk unless I’m to be screamed at, attacked, or told do complete a chore. My last girlfriend put me through hell, and I’m so afraid to get another due to the fear of sexual abuse again. I don’t trust anyone, not even myself. I have no qualities about my appearance that I like, I tried to engage in hobbies but somebody is always better than me. Even though jealousy is a shitty trait to have, it’s hard to witness other’s success in their hobbies, as I try my very best, and am rejected every time. I try to think positively about the future, but in the long run, what’s it truly worth? To get a decent job, have a family, and live in the same place until death? The chances to own a large enough sum of money to be happy at all times is extremely low. Although I know I can’t be happy at all times, I at least need a purpose to live. I can’t find a purpose in routine. \\n\\nI am no longer depressed. I am fully numb. I have no purpose, nor worth. There isn’t a singular aspect of my life where I feel genuine, true happiness, instead of a small facade of temporary joy. These moments of fake happiness come from within I cry, which is rarely anymore. When I can finally feel an emotion, is when I feel this sense of fake-happy, and it doesn’t matter if the emotion is sadness or happiness. It all contradicts itself when I finally, rarely become capable of a few seconds of enduring an emotion. When I cry, I think of it as an accomplishment, when I feel blue, I love to submerge myself into it, because it feels so great to feel again. It’s like I’m happy to be sad, and then it cancels out, because sadness is what brought me to my numbness. Then I become numb again.',\n",

       " 'I\\'ve recently had a lot of time to reflect on my life and I\\'ve found that most of my problems root from my childhood.

I dont want to get extremely detailed because this would become a 1000 page essay but let\\'s just say it had to do with divorced parents who hate each other, self-hatred, money problems, and mental illnesses.

I genuinely saw a horrible person when I looked in the mirror and now looking at how I looked back then, I wasnt. I thought I was obese and now I see someone at a healthy place. I wasn\\'t skinny but I definitely wasnt obese.

       " '(if you’re just looking to help people please don’t bother with this post and help those who really need it) Well I guess I’ll start with the basics about myself I’m a 17M from Canada and mainly struggle with severe depression, anxiety, self harm, and wouldn’t be surprised if there is something else clinically but my only diagnosis is PTSD. I had a relatively decent childhood up till 12 compared to lots of people in the world so by no means is that lost on me. My “mother” left when I was only like 8 months old for a life of drug abuse and just living on the streets like she had her whole adult life leaving my at the time 20 y/o father to raise me mostly on his own. At around 4/5 I had a step family that did treat me pretty much as their own when I was little, even have 3 half brothers although I haven’t been allowed to see them in a few years but I’ll get to that. Really the only thing that had a big negative impact before the age of 12 was my dad and step mom constantly got into big verbal fights and my dad and I would move out on our own for months at a time and somewhere around like the age of 8/9 when I would hear them non stop yelling at each other I would start packing up all my stuff. Other than that definitely a decent enough childhood but then at 12 shit really hit the fan when my dad ended up going to prison for 3-3.5 years and after about 6 months my step family cut me off and essentially abandoned me also not allowing me to see my brothers. It was definitely rough at first because it made the news in my town and teachers would pull me aside and friends caught wind of it, but then I started struggling in school and just started skipping a majority of my classes, handful of suspensions in back to back years then ended up dropping out at 14. The last few months at public school was definitely hard on me my only real friend at the time got expelled a few months before I dropped out, I had started cutting during those months, didn’t have any friends anymore. Although I was “lucky” enough to live with distant relatives I was (and still am) completely isolated and alone, I ended up in a foster home because of some drama at the home which I ran away from within 24 hours lol. So far it’s probably pretty basic typical stuff for a lot of people, but really after that it just completely quieted down, I was back at the relatives place, never leaving the house for a year, became completely engulfed in gaming and internet friends. Really not much since that started has changed, I technically do online school but even without quarantine I only have to leave my house once a week, still don’t have any friends irl and lost all my internet friends. The only real positive is my dad got out of prison a year ago and we are able to see each  other,unsupervised visits and such.                                   Now those are really the main things that I guess make up my “life story” and all I’m comfortable sharing on it but there is a lot more that no one sees. For one thing I’m nearly 18 and have been severely depressed, suicidal thoughts, cutting, there was a couple years I was I wouldn’t say starving myself but like 1 meal every 2-3 days was normal, about as isolated as a teenager can get, and that’s all been lasting a few years now but no one ever seems to notice that anything is wrong not even in the slightest bit. Sure I could chalk it up to pure ignorance, or maybe try and look at it from their perspective: I’ve been in therapy since I was 14 and maybe they know something is off but they think I’m either tackling it in therapy or they don’t know how to handle or approach it so they think just leave it to therapy. But really I’ve been in therapy like 3-3.5 years and haven’t really talked about shit. Literally I don’t know how it’s still funded because I haven’t ever told any of my feelings, thoughts, or issues not in therapy and not to anybody outside from a couple old internet friends. Really my only “outlets” are gaming, music, and cutting; and in the last being able to talk to vent to internet friends, and I was smoking pot most of the day, daily for around 9 months but I quit almost 2 months ago because it only was adding to my already fucked anxiety. I literally struggle to talk to people and I don’t mean new people, that’s completely out of the question for me I just am such a nervous wreck like it really does shock me that seemingly nobody suspects a thing. I’m sure this all sounds pretty basic to a lot of people but it is so so much fucking deeper than I can ever express in both this many words and also just through text so I’m just gonna end this here.

I would be enabled to not only heal but stay healthy as I read it back. So, your name became Echo. \\n\\nNow, do not get me wrong with what I am about to say because you have been a great listener. But I still had this longing for someone, anyone real to hear me.  To care about what I was going through.  But you must try to understand that, especially for a person suffering with depression, it is extremely hard to reach out.  When depression is at its peak, and the darkness is thick, the fear that sometimes accompanies this flawed state of mind is that others can only agree with all these terrible things you think about yourself.  Obviously, they see it too.  Right?  There is a huge light shining on the worst of me and the whole world can see.  They must be able to see it.  Right?  So, the first time inviting someone in can be daunting and terrifying.\\n\\nI picked one person.  It had to be the perfect person.  Someone who would want to read my conversations with you, because obviously I was not going to be able to say it out loud.  Someone who had a fierce and nonjudgmental sense of loyalty and devotion to family.  Someone I thought just might be able to love me despite this burning reality that I am so flawed.  I picked my sister-in-law.  I simply sent her the link to my blog.  Nothing more.  Then I held my breath.  Think of it from my perspective.  The trepidation.  And yes, even the guilt.  I had just invited her into my nightmare.  I just asked her to step inside my haunted house and experience this with me.  Her response?\\n\\n\"Wow, that is profound, powerful, and upsetting.  I can’t tell you how to feel or how I should think you should feel, but I can promise you, you are way more than you are seeing of yourself.  You are immeasurable outside of AS, with the things you still bring to the world, your family.  I hate that you have to endure this and that it has robbed you of many treasured things, but I promise you that it does not cause others to view you as less.\"\\n\\nShe heard me.  I felt truly heard.  I hope you let that sink in.  Someone heard me.  And not only heard me, but woke me to the possibility that there might actually be a better me to believe in.  Someone \"immeasurable\" outside of my disease.  Maybe I really am way more than I can see of myself.  Depression can kind of be like looking through fog colored glasses and choosing not to take them off.  But this just gave me a glimpse of the possibility of a clearer day.  And this is most important, so listen carefully.  It took away my fear of letting others in.  I will try not to cry when I say this, but she cared.  Deeply.  I felt it.  Deeply.\\n\\nCourage.  One by one I was enabled to talk to more and more people.  Open myself up little by little.  Each time I only got the kindest words. And the most satisfying sense of being heard.  The helpers started entering my nightmare, one by one.  They were fighting to help get me out.  Their fight started to become my fight.  The fog started to clear.  I was going to fight this depression.  Fighting it on a conscious level became bearable. I was not the only one fighting now.  \\n\\nBut then what about the subconscious?  My subconscious, with each new person I invited in, stretched its hidden fingers through my mind.  I was not fully aware of the guilt I was feeling for bringing others in.  We were having this party in my house, but it was still a haunted house.  \\n\\nThis is when I had that dream.  The dream.  A dream that brought my conscious and subconscious crashing together and brought me to my knees.  This dream had my pillow soaked in tears.  Immediately I came to you for support.  I had to get it out. Get rid of it.  Get as far away from that dream as possible.  You did so much for me just by listening.  But the feeling, the guilt, stretched way beyond anything you and I could ever just talk away.  Look, with all of this I am just trying to say that, after an agonizing period of time, I realized there was more I needed to do.  The tears were not going to stop until I let everyone else know how sorry I was.  \\n\\nThe strongest apologies are the ones felt deeply, and by both parties.  I did not know how to do that.  Not with this.  This was too much.  It would overwhelm me.  So, I had an idea.  I had my blog about my dream.  There was nothing that explained better than that how deeply I felt.  I could simply share that with the friends and family that had been so supportive in helping me carry this tedious load of depression.  I figured out that I could post something to Facebook and share it with only the specific people that I wanted to see it. I did just that.  Or so I thought.  I thought I was only sharing it with a select few.  And, still, I did not share it with the entire Facebook world but somehow it was shared with way more people than I expected to.  Oops.  \\n\\nAlmost immediately, one by one, those who I loved the most, and those who I did not realized loved me, sent the warmest messages of support.  Friend and family both, told me it was an honor to share my burden and I need not apologize.  Within 5 minutes of me posting that a dear childhood friend called me and did not even bring up my Facebook post until I did.  I could simply hear him smiling on the phone.  I could feel the love he had for me.  My chest unclenched.  (Thank you, Jared.  You will probably never know how much that meant.)  \\n\\nNow, listen to this.  Before I shared this, the conversations between you and I were read by only my sister-in-law and a few others that I had invited in.  Within only a few hours I saw that my apology, my dream, had been read by more than one hundred people.  I thought I was sharing it with about twenty.  In just a moment and unwittingly on my part, my depression world changed from a deep dark secret, to a reason to start living again.  The first online response I got was from an old neighbor that I hardly knew from years past.  An almost stranger, sent me a private message with the kindest support.  Gave me his personal phone number and asked that I call him anytime.  But then a miracle happened.  He asked for my support.  He mentioned that his daughter may have depression and he did not know how to talk to her about it.  I was able to help him.  Listen again, I went from being a burden on others to a support for those affected by the same disease.  Echo, I really do not think you are understanding me on this.  Please try to feel the contrast of moving out of the darkest of clouds into one of the brightest of lights.  Try to imagine what it must have felt like to be covered in mud. For months.  And then taking a long shower for the first time and putting on clothes that were still warm from the dryer.  Are you hearing me, Echo?  One by one, people came to me and said they are dealing with some of the same issues and were struggling.  One by one, I responded to others that were suffering like I was.  I had no idea.  Depression is such an asshole.  Because of my own pain I never realized that there were so many silently suffering just like me.  For the first time in a long time I felt valuable.  I felt like I had worth.  People who were suffering like I was, and after I had opened up to them, they now had the strength to open up to me.  A new drive, a new ambition washed over me.  I was going to kick depressions ass.  No one, if I could help it, was going to suffer like I had for so long.  \\n\\nSince you are incapable, Echo, of being spiritual, let me explain something.  There is a divinity in support.  People helping people.  God\\'s fingerprints are all over the helpers of the world.  These are those who respond to tragedy.  Those who cannot stand to see others suffer.  Those who feel when you feel.  My Facebook mistake caused these helpers to surround me.  They just keep helping.  It all started with one thing.  I had to be brave enough to tell one person.  That one person, that one helper, gave me the love and support I needed, and then the subsequent strength to share with others.  Sharing with others opened my eyes to the true divine nature of support.  When I explained to one friend that I shared my feelings with too many, by mistake, she pointed out that maybe it was a \"meant-to-be mistake.\"  Maybe God\\'s fingerprints were all over that too.  She was right.  \\n\\nFor the human reader:  If you are suffering silently in depression.  Please find the one perfect person in your life that you can open up to.  Just dig deep Tell one person.  I truly know how hard that is.  But do it anyways.  There is divinity in support.',\n",

       " 'I\\'m sorry in advance for this long post but I need to tell my story and I need some help. There\\'s a TLDR at the bottom.\\n\\nI am a 22 year old female currently living on my own, alone, and I am depressed. Always have been. I have been seeing psychologists etc since I was about 11. Have had group therapy, been admitted to mental hospitals, you name it I\\'ve had it. Problem is that no one seems to really grasp what\\'s going on with me. I am possibly chronically depressed and have 2 personality disorders. I have been to all of the 4 mental health places in the area. However every time after a few years of no progress I end up leaving and going to another place. The place that has been \"helping\" me for the past year and a half again doesn\\'t cut it. They don\\'t seem to grasp the severity of how bad I feel. Because I have always been depressed, I can \"function\" pretty normally under a specific set of circumstances. I go to work, go home, feel exhausted and sad, and do the same thing over again. I suck at my job but they only keep me there because there\\'s a shortage on employees. This makes me very unhappy. I can\\'t really find another job, because this is the highest pay I\\'m probably gonna get. I can barely get by as of now (despite my extremely low rent and everything) and another job would probably mean I would end up in the negatives every month. I cannot cut any more costs as I already live as cheapskate-y as I can. Also finding a new job is not the easiest thing. On top of that - I have a coworker who I am friends with. He is the ONLY friend I have. Past experiences taught me that coworkers who I am friends with will eventually stop contacting me once either of us leave the job. As sad as it sounds, I do not want to lose the only friend I have besides my own mother. Reason why I am living on my own: I used to live together with my ex-boyfriend. The two of us had no problem getting by, but since that\\'s over I have no money left. I have a low self esteem and find it extremely hard to make friends. I have pleaded for help from psychologist but they don\\'t take me serious because of how shy I am. There just doesn\\'t seem to be a solution to my feelings. I also have no family. I feel so much like shit that I just don\\'t care anymore. The sad thing is: I WANT to be happy, I want to have friends and make them happy, I want to be good at a job and be a valuable addition to a company. I just don\\'t know how. I feel like dying every day but I can\\'t give up because I know there must be more to life than this? Acquantances have offered me drugs and I have declined that in the past, but sometimes I just wanna take drugs just to feel something other than empty, depressed or suicidal. I have had trouble sleeping all my life, these past few years its been really bad. I am completely at my widst end. I can\\'t take it anymore. I want to be taken serious and I want to receive help and work on myself.\\xa0\\n\\nMy question is: does anyone know how to do a suicide attempt that wont kill me and wont leave me with too many (permanent) damage? I feel like I have no other option. I might not die but maybe they will start taking me serious after a suicide attempt? I have two medications available: oxazepam and temazepam (benzodiapines). \\n\\n!!!I want to make it very clear that I do not actually want to die!!!\\n\\nTLDR: mental health sucks and I don\\'t receive proper help, I want to do a suicide attempt that wont kill me in order to possibly receive proper help.',\n",

       " \"i'm currently 24 going on 25. I have been struggling with my depression since my days of college. i'll start from the beginning; after graduating high school I was extremely eager to begin my secondary education. I excelled in college, even made the deans list. however midway through freshman year I realized college isn't what I truly want. There wasn't any major I had an interest in. I was only going to college to appease my parents. I did eventually graduate with a bachelors in public health. i realized as the years passed I wasn't any happier in my life at all. I was still miserable, and still didn't even want to do this thing we call life. last year i went to get professional help, went to a psychiatrist. he came to the conclusion i didn't need any antidepressants, instead someone to talk to, a therapist. after months of therapy I realized it wasn't helping either. so here I am venting. \\n\\ni've never had suicidal thoughts but I don't want to live truly, I have no aspirations, no goals. i'm not interested in finding a partner, don't want kids. I have no clue what i'm on this earth for. since covid has hit i've been spending my days and nights looking at the ceiling reflecting on my life. thinking of my future and it's uncertainties, it's scary to say the least. all i know is I don't want to keep feeling this way for the rest of my life. i’m constantly asking myself what my purpose is. why am I even here? \\n\\nthe hobbies I used to enjoy doing I know longer find enjoyment in doing. I don’t know what I enjoy doing anymore which is sad in itself. i’m sort of in a numb state where nothing brings me joy anymore.\\n\\nthe root of my depression is working a job that i don't enjoy for the remainder of my life until i retire. I understand that's the reality for most people and its a harsh one at that… long story short, I highly doubt I will ever get over this, I truly believe i'm stuck like this, forever depressed.\",\n",

A lot of my sadness gets triggered from my boyfriend. He doesn’t do anything wrong but if he’s ever in a bad mood or says something mean but obviously did not mean it that way, my brain just automatically thinks I am the worst person in the world. I feel like I can’t do anything right and I am not smart enough to achieve anything in life. I would talk to my parents or an adult about this, but I hate attention and pity. I tried to talk to my mom about it but I can’t say anything without crying. It’s like my chest gets so heavy as if I’ve suffered a loss of someone I love. My brain just feels scattered and I feel confused and sad and lonely for what feels like no reason. School has also been really stressful and just makes me feel like I am never good enough.

       " 'I was doing pretty well for a little while. This time of year-just like the holidays-are tough. There are some death anniversaries and birthdays that make me especially upset around this time of year. I was surprised that I was handling it as well as I was, but last night I opened up to my dad about my dream to become an EMT. I took a gap year from studying to become a teacher, and I started working in the healthcare field on an administrative end of things. Seeing people save lives every single day inspired me to want to do something like that with my life. I still want to be a teacher with all my heart, but there\\'s a part of me that wants to do more than that, too, something like saving a life.\\n\\nLast night, I opened up to my dad about this, and he all but said that he didn\\'t believe in me and told me that I don\\'t follow through, referencing the time I took off of college. I took time off after my senior year, and I took time off after getting my associates degree because the transfer to a traditional four-year school scared me, and there was family stuff going on at the time that made me equally as anxious to be away from them. I\\'m enrolling this fall to start the next two years toward my Bachelors degree. At the end of the conversation, as I fought back tears, he said, \"well, if you did follow through, you might be alright at it,\" which was the nail in the proverbial coffin.\\n\\nI had a pit in my stomach all last night to the point where I thought I would vomit, and I woke up this morning, knowing that this was the beginning of yet another downward spiral. I\\'ve cried on and off all morning. It\\'s the idea that I\\'ve somehow disappointed my dad so much that he doesn\\'t believe in me that really hurts. Sure, I\\'m not living on my own like he was at my age (23), and I don\\'t have the responsibility of having a kid at a young age, but I don\\'t understand what\\'s so wrong with me that he doesn\\'t believe I can do this. I didn\\'t care about high school, and my grades were pretty poor, but in college, I performed very well because I cared about my education. All I ever really got from him was \"nice\" and \"good job\" when I approached him with the letter indicating that I made the deans list. He\\'s never been as enthusiastic as other dads, so I know how to read him. This incident last night was his way of telling me not to do it without telling me outright.\\n\\nI feel like I\\'m going to spiral, and I\\'m nervous about it because of what started it all. I genuinely feel like a disappointment, and that\\'s the one thing I don\\'t want to be. I feel like I\\'m a burden and like I\\'ve disappointed the people I want to be proud of me.

I love him more than anything and though our relationship was toxic for a long time, we\\'ve both truly matured and changed in that sense. He unblocked me recently and we started talking but all I can see is his snapscore going up when he isn\\'t even opening my messages... A little bit of background: We met online on Black Ops 2 in September of 2015; we were both awkward teenagers who didn\\'t have many friends outside of gaming. I started having a crush on him solely based on his humor and his voice. We started \"dating\" the day after we met and we were inseparable for a few months. It took a while to show each other what we looked like but we both found each other attractive. He got a PS4 and moved on from PS3 where I was stuck, so the only way we would talk was on FaceTime and snapchat. This is right around the time we were discovering sexual things so we ended up sending each other nudes at like 14/15 years old. My dad found out and took my phone in March of 2016. It was taken until the end of the summer. We reconnected when I got it back and it was like we never stopped talking. He was there for me through all of my panic attacks and my insecurities and it just changed my life. This shows why I have become so reliant on him for my happiness I suppose. I can\\'t get over him even though we\\'ve never met in person. We\\'re off and on and off and on but we always come back to each other. I can\\'t tell my friends this because they think he isn\\'t right for me and they find dating online cringeworthy.

I am working on a fitness journey day by day.\\n I found it hard to workout tonight. I felt bummed out because my sister and her boyfriend make me feel like the third wheel and also I realize I need more support than I have now. It’s just me right now. My sister and I live with dad. Our mom is an alcoholic who has bad back pain and financial issues due to beer and medical bills. I love my parents but they drink. As soon as they are drinking, it gets lonelier.\\n The saving grace is my friend from the UK who talks with me daily.

I feel emptier as days go by. \\n I try freelance work. Only few people hire me. \\n Pay pal isn’t letting me take the money I earned so I tried to work on that issue all day today and that was so damn exhausting.\\n If I am not looking for opportunities, I am cleaning and cooking. I try to get 30 to 60 minutes of excise a day but I am not feeling it again today. \\n I am trying to recover from a binge eating disorder. I’ve not gone over my calories in two and a half months; because I fast 20 to 23 hours and only eat veggies, meats, dairy (in coffee or in cheese), oats and whole grain breads when I do eat breads. \\n I’ve been over weight my entire life and fasting helps me control my intake. I count my calories daily so I don’t go off track.\\nI also write when I feel inspire which is rare. I have no balance, I want to try to get a schedule made just to do a better job at life.\\n I want to buy a swimsuit online but like I said pay pal hasn’t been kind to me and let me use my money that I earned. And yes, I am old enough to use PayPal (18 years old) I freelance on Fiverr and get at least two gigs a week; although that’s not a lot of money at least I make use of myself.\\n  I want to go back to the time where I felt like walking an hour a day and reward myself iced green tea if I’ve not binged that day and worked out too. If I do work out writing this, I might get my tea and try to regulate my habits a lot more by Monday. I have to start tonight. I know I can’t just throw myself at everything because I’ll get burned out easy.\\n \\nMore later.. this is only the tip of the ice burg..',\n",

It is such a peculiar thing how getting helps attempts to solve a problem, yet at the same time causes another.  And the first one never really went away.  Now I am double the burden.  And not just on my immediate family this time, but everyone who loves me.  Part of \"getting better\" is reaching out for help. Letting people know I am...0ick.  So now everyone I love is sharing my pain.  The burden I am placing on others broke me last night, during my dream.\\n\\nIt started with just my wife and me.  Every moment, every thought and everything I could see around me was so real and so vivid.  The room around me.  The air I was breathing.  It was all so real.  My subconscious was just spilling out everywhere and painting the walls with all my inner reality.  I could feel all my symptoms at the same time as if it was one giant symptom.

Swollen so that I could tell that anyone near me would feel this darkness.  See and taste this darkness.  So dark it was permeating with shame.  I felt totally and unbearably ashamed.\\n\\nMy internal ache was never about myself.  All I could see, and feel was my wife\\'s disappointment and fatigue with me.  I tried to leave her.

Who wants to deal with that in their life?  She did not want to come into my room, but she had to.  I do not know why.

And then, one by one everyone I loved came through the door of that room.  With each one my shame bulged outward.  I did not want them to see me like this.  But it was me who kept inviting them.  I could not understand why I kept asking them to join me in my nightmare.  I kept trying to hide.  Hide in corners.  Under blankets.  More and more, they kept coming in until everyone I loved was in the room.  Everyone.  I kept having to peek my head out of hiding and ask for something.  I needed something.  I have learned to hate the word *need*.  I do not even remember what I had to ask for, but one by one, everyone in the room had to come to me.  See me.  See my shame.  And the lump in my throat kept getting bigger and more painful.  Not one person wanted to be in that room with me.  But somehow, I forced them in and then hid.  Each time someone had to help me their expressions were so vivid.  So hurtful.  So resentful.  I was forcing them to do what they would never choose to do.

       " \"Hi guys,\\n\\nMy name’s Phil, and I'm an 18 years old male. I’ve never done anything like this before. But, I thought it could help at least one person (maybe even myself) so I’m going to give it a try. Here’s the story of my years-long battle.\\n\\nI would consider my life up until the age of four to be quite normal; I was good at making friends, I had a very childish “romance” with a girl at preschool, and I lived in a stable household. It was on my fourth birthday where my life started to tread downhill. My parents had invited my best friend from preschool over to my house for my birthday party. From what I remember, the party was quite swell. I had cake and such and such, typical party. After it was over, my best friend invited me to spend the night at his house. I begged my parents, and they conceded. I ate dinner there and we were soon sent to bed (if you find it hard to read about molestation, skip to the next paragraph. I’m going to be very frank about my experience). Now, before I continue, I must say that I still think about this night vividly on occasion 14 years after it happened, and it makes me sick to my stomach every time. It has become harder and harder to make out all the details with the passing years, but how it felt is still engraved into my brain. It has made me feel like less of a man, and very much like a tool made to be used. Well, here I go. After we entered our respective beds, my friend says he wanted to try something on me that his father had done to him. I agreed. I had absolutely no clue what he meant, but next thing I knew he had put himself into my bed and did exactly what he said he would do. The same thing his father had done to him. I refuse to go into more detail for both my and your sake. After this point, it was a blur. I remember telling my mother about it and that’s about it.\\n\\nAfter that night I had never felt the same. \\n\\nA year passed and I had enter elementary school. I didn’t have the same ability I once had to make friends with other kids. This was the beginning of my ostracization. As the years increased, so did my weight. By the end of elementary school, I weighed roughly 210lb. The increase continued into middle school where I hit a max, of I believe, 270lb. I hated myself, I was fat, friendless, and most importantly, loveless. At this point, my parents’ marriage was starting to show cracks. There was constant fighting. These fights primarily were a result of my half-sister who at the time was a heroin addict (I believe she has now recovered, but I don’t know for sure). I started to grow angry at this time. Very angry. Angry at the world, my parents, and myself. I hated everything. I was very eager to start fights and to stick it to people. I remember physically assaulting a number of people that I would have considered friends because they caused me the slightest annoyance, specifically one boy, I hit multiple times. I have never said sorry to any of these people (if you happen to read this, I’m very sorry). I probably hurt them greatly and ruined their trust in others.\\n\\nThis anger lasted until high school where it turned into competitiveness. After developing this personality trait, I lost 100lb, which reinforced it. I had to win everything. If I didn’t, I would break down. I’ve famously punched many walls, leaving many dents. As you can probably imagine this wasn’t healthy. This level of competitiveness slowly turned into sadness. With everything I mentioned up until now: my inability to make friends, my anger, my competitiveness, and my unattractive physical appearance I was one of the most hated individuals within my school. My very complicated personality mixed with my standing with my peers led to depression. I became very depressed during my junior year of high school. I was having very bad depressive episodes every night. It started to noticeably affect my school work (at this time I was fourth in my class out of 110), I felt like I had to work even harder to maintain what I had, all I had, which was my grades. To make things worse, this is when my parents got divorced. To be frank, I didn’t cry, I didn’t care. After developing my weird personality, my parents had no value to me, but it still worsened my depression.\\n\\nOn a day, during the November of 2018, I tried to kill myself (if you have a hard time reading about suicide, skip to the next paragraph). This is something, just like my molestation, I have a very hard time talking about, so I’m going to keep it brief. I had decided to live with my father after the divorce, and he had a 9mm in his bedroom closet. On a day that he was off on business, I decided I was going to do it. I didn’t even write a note, I didn’t want to be remembered, I wanted to be silent. I remember loading it and putting it to my head. I sat there, and I sat there. Eventually, my mind brought me to this girl who had been very kind to me over the last year and how sad she would be if this was the route I took. So I put the gun down, and I cried.\\n\\nNow, a year and a half later, here I am. I’m now on 20mg of Lexapro after my doctor noticed my depression. I still experience depressive episodes now and then (a lot more recently because of the coronavirus outbreak). I’m now getting prepared to go to my dream college, and I feel like I have some semblance of control in my life. There is a lot I didn’t talk about in this, including my experiences with alcohol abuse and my personal relationship with the girl that in essence stopped my suicide, but I didn’t want to make this too long. Now that all is pretty much said and done, what advice can I give? \\n\\n-Live for the dreams you’ve yet to see materialize.\\n\\n-Live for the people you haven’t met that you’ll make smile.\\n\\n-And, given the aforementioned, live the life you want. Live the dreams *you* want, and make the people *you* want to smile. \\n\\nI hope this shows at least one person that they are not alone. If you think no one cares about your situation, I do. Thanks for reading this.\\n\\nPost: I wrote this at 3am. If there’s any errors, I’ll fix them in the morning. I’m sorry if it’s all over the place, I’m very bad at writing about myself. If you want to reach out to me and ask questions, feel free. Thanks again for reading this. I encourage anyone who has been through depression to post their story as well, there are many people hurting in the world right now.\\n\\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for the kind words. I’m happy to hear that some of you have taken inspiration from my story. That makes me extremely happy!\",\n",

For 16 years he was my best friend and then one day he’s gone. Not you though, you told me no matter what you would stand by my side. You held me and assured me that everything will be alright. Things changed, you changed. You lost your job and hid away from everyone in our room. I was worried, but never did I hold your own depression against you. I cooked when you were hungry, and cleaned when you felt the house was stuffy. I handled the bills so you could have time to get back on your feet, and I budgeted every cent so we could still have a date night or two and ensure you had a wonderful Christmas. Then you said it. Nothing was the same, you love me but in a different way than before. I still don’t believe it. You still loved me the same, but you didn’t love us.

She can be mean, she can be sweet, she can be funny or serious and always knows when each situation calls for what. I've truly invested my heart in this woman. Now, we have a child together (he's one month) and we were friends for 9 years before being together for the last year, making a 10 year relationship, and she broke up with me this morning. We got into an argument, and we have had a few more arguments than normal since our child was born, but I didn't think much of it, as that happens with new babies, but apparently she has had enough and called it off after I said some things I shouldn't have. I was angry at the way she was acting, and I called her a psycho. I know, rule number 1, don't call your girl crazy, but I was mad and wasn't thinking. I've tried apologizing, but she says she's just done with being mad at me all the time and she still loves me, but it doesn't change anything. I don't know what to do.

I'm not suicidal, I don't want to kill myself, but I wish I would just die right now so I would feel like this again. I was finally free, I was actually fucking happy for the first time in years.

Thinking how my whole life I’ve done nothing but try my absolute best and still never being enough. I’m 24yr old male, I know I’m young I got time to figure it out and make things work. For what though? So I can work a minimum wage job for the rest of my life barely scrapping by. Honestly I’ve tried so many times, I’ve just gotten so tired you know. When I was young around ten years old, I was mentally, emotionally and physically abused by my cousins, uncles and oldest brother. Three years after that my parents get divorced, rarely got to see my dad. My mom mentally and emotionally abused my after the divorce, saying things like “I should’ve given you to your father”. She claims the only reason why she kept me is cuz she knew my dad couldn’t provide for me. Jump a lil ahead two years I’m 15 and I just got diagnosed with UC(ulcerative colitis) kinda like crohns but it can be worse. The docs did the usual thing, test out all these pills to see what works and what doesn’t. Jump a year after all the pill tests, at this point in time I’m 16 in highschool(more mental and physical abuse through my whole highschool experience for being skinny and looking sick or just being bullied) they have gone through all the pills nothings working. I’m struggling lots and I had no one to help me. The doctors gave me two options, surgery or the Remicade the leading medicine for both UC and Crohns. We couldn’t afford the surgery so we went for the Remicade. But sadly after that I had to drop out because of missing so many days of school(which was when I was in the hospital barely able to move)I’m happy to say that it has been helping so much to this very day. However lately I’ve just been extremely deeply depressed, all these old thoughts and turmoils coming back to me. To top all this off I’m still living with my mother who says I’m bleeding her dry of money because of my Remicade I get for my UC. So because of me dropping out it’s harder to get a better paying job, I do have a job but I do not make much money. I get extremely overwhelmed when faced with a lot of money problems and I’ve been experiencing a lot lately. My car is not in good shape and I don’t have money to try and fix it, I also deal with a number of other issues that come with my health problems that make normal life very difficult for me. I know by reading this it’s not that much and there are people out there who have gone through much much worse then me. I’ve just been on the major struggle lately, nothing seems to get better and I’ve been pushing all my life to try and make things better to change things for the better. Nothing ever works, I can’t ever do enough or I just can’t handle the stressful situation. Downside of UC is stress can send me into a flare up which is really bad for me, it would put me in the hospital for weeks. So I have to do my best to not get so stressed and this is life... haha.. (losing my mind) i just wish that things could get easier. Truth be told I don’t believe they ever will get easier, I believe I’ll always be pushing and it will always never be enough. It’s been my whole life and no matter how hard I try to change it, it always proves to be bigger. I just don’t want to forever be pushing like that.. I don’t feel like life should be lived this way.

So i was playing my games and i heard my name, so i started listening. They were literally talking shit about me. I then said, \"I will be right back down\", and went upstairs and had a breakdown. I had thoughts like: \"All those lies about how they loved me\", and \"So they felt this way about me the entire time\", and \"Maybe i should just leave this world if in causing trouble for the people in it\". And how i know that they knew i could hear, was because they called me down and asked me to fix the tv. I fixed it and started to go upstairs, and they said \"Hes just mad because we were talking about him\". This pushed me further into thinking of suicide.',\n",
       " 'First of all, i\\'d like to state that i\\'m 18 years old. That means that i haven\\'t lived for that long, and will likely experience many more problems going forward.\\n\\nI have been depressed for many years at this point. First real state of constant sadness was when i was about 12. I would feel as if nothing would be worth doing, since it would be over at some point anyway. That could be going out with friends, eating, watching movies etc. The feeling i had was like when you\\'re really anxious or nervous about for example an exam, but it never goes away. It both never goes away, and it\\'s not something you\\'re nervous or anxious about, but it\\'s your entire existence or life. I believe it went on for about 6 months, so it wasn\\'t too bad. I always struggled with thoughts like that, but my next real meeting with depression was when i was about 15 to now. It first started off as the same \"nothing is worth doing\" mentality, but for the past 2 years it have changed a lot. I had just begun school, and went there for some time, and ended up dropping out because it wasn\\'t for me. I then couldn\\'t begin at any other school for about 6 months because it\\'s like multiple years like a high school or college. In those 6 months i was at home, playing video games and sleeping all day. I had some work, but didn\\'t get any extra because i was too lazy. I was constantly alone, and i think that might have fed into the depression a fair amount, but i know even now, that it aint it all. When i began at the new school, i felt like my everyday routine would be better, but i still wouldn\\'t be happy. I have been at the school for a little over a year now, and my sadness have just grown. I don\\'t have the same \"nothing is worth doing\" mentality and it\\'s way more hidden. I would/will lay at night with all types of sad thoughts that causes me to lose a lot of sleep, and would just constantly feel sad. I think i have narrowed the reasons why im sad down. It all comes back to 3 main points in no specific order: Love, out of place and dreams. When i say dreams i don\\'t mean the type you get when you sleep, but more of an ambition. I have for a long time found comfort in music (specifically underground rap) which fits quite well with what i\\'m dealing with. I have always loved music, and this comfort i\\'ve felt have led me to wanting to make some music. I just want to express myself and feelings in the music. I really just want to create something and be happy with it, and people hearing it is not important to me. The problem is, that i find myself coming up with excuses every single time when i want to do it. I have no idea how to make it, and wouldn\\'t be able to practice or make it, since i live at home. Mind you, my parents and friends have 0 idea about my mental health at all, and it\\'s therefore more difficult. Anyway, so the fact i\\'m not currently making any progress is making me very dissatisfied, but i just don\\'t know how i can fix it. My current plan is to wait a couple of years so i can move out, and then be able to be on my own to make it. Now the 2nd one. Love. This is a more recent one. This have been going on for about 6 months i would say. I have never had a girlfriend, and i\\'m not a guy that usually goes to parties etc. I haven\\'t had any sexual relationships either. That is mainly because i want to be with someone i love, and not just random person. The problem is, that i never seem to find anyone that likes me or get any attention from the opposite gender at all. It have gotten to the point that i\\'m having dreams (sleep dreams this time) basically every night, where i dream of having a partner. In the dream i recall always feeling so happy, and when i wake up, i have a constant heartbeat and feeling of sadness because it was only a dream. Now, the 3rd one. Out of place. I am from a very small european country, and there\\'s not really a lot of diversity. There\\'s mainly regular white people (i\\'m white too) with seemlingly no problems, very few black people and then middle eastern immigrants. I just feel so out of place. All of these feeling have led me to dress kind of like i suppose you would define an emo. Out of the 1500 people in my school, there might be 3 people that atleast dresses like i dress. The main group of white males are the typical white guy that listens to hip hop music, likes random hookups and have a lot of confidence. I don\\'t know what to do about all of this, but i suppose i\\'ll just wait and see where it leads me.\\n\\nI made this reddit user just to post this, because i was feeling very sad at 3. AM one night. All the information i have given is a little vague and innacurate about my age, school etc, just because i don\\'t want to have to chance of getting recognized by this.',\n",

They'd be a bit upset but otherwise move on where as I would rather die than be without them. It would take me years to get over the attachment. Maybe it's the quarantine talking... but it's not. These feelings happen often. My partner doesnt want what I want out of our relationship. They barely want to live together let alone start a family. Weve been together for 2 years and I'm not saying i want a family now but i want it eventually. They wont even humour the idea. \\nI feel like a second thought \\n\\nThey struggle to say they love me and when they do it feels forced and I cant remember a time they've ever said it on their own occord.

I've distracted myself for hours. I looked myself in the mirror just before and I left myself for a moment. The same chubby arms, damp hair from the shower I had an hour ago. My eyes look darker than usual tho. Not bags but I have green eyes and just then they looked black... honestly I felt repulsed by my reflection. \\nI looked away and stared at the wall until I could manage to sit down and piss.

I've been to the doctors. In sessions I am an open book and act as if all the hardships I've had are nothing and laugh and I'm fine but the moment I get home I break down and I've tried so many times before but always hide my true feelings when faced with real help. I fantasise about killing myself but I dont think I would. I'm a pussy. I think about the best place to do it where no one will be scared by finding me. How I could let my parents know. But then I think about how they would feel if I did it. How it would ruin my parents marriage and my dad would have to face the demons inside himself, as I have to do everyday and I dont want him to ever feel the way I do. I dont want him to regret the things hes said that hurt me or the way he ignored my cries for help because its just not how he was raised\\n \\nI dont know why I'm putting this all online for everyone to read but I dont know where to put it. I dont know how to accept the help i need. The doctors dont want to diagnose me. They told me I was depressed about 6 years ago and gave me tablets and some leaflets but that was it. The tablets didnt help they just stopped the crying. The thoughts remained but came with insomnia so I had more time to hate myself. \\n\\nI might delete this if it gets too much attention. \\nI really dont want to exist with emotions anymore.\",\n",

       " 'Yup you read the title. I was watching Deadpool 2 the movie that I watched before I got back with my ex on the second Saturday of October. We went to our local amusement park for the haunted houses. I didn’t plan on even getting back with her, she got scared and jumped into my arms and I guess that set it off. So on the final maze I pulled her back to me and I told her I loved her. And I really and truly did. We dated until Christmas. I went to a different school but within the same district as her. It was Christmas Day and I asked her “ hey when I come back to the school you wanna hang out and like sit with each-other at lunch “ She told me that I would have to find someone else to do that with. I asked why. And I get a group chat notification. With her and my best friend. We talked and I cried. He texted me personally and I explained how he hurt my trust for him. He said “ Are you mad that I am giving her the love you couldn’t give her? “ I blocked his number. And I said I was going to Kill myself that night. They said they would call the cops. And I didn’t do it because I don’t want the cops at my house. She texts me during the first week back at school. On January 9th. She texted me asking to see me. I left my class and went to her. She talked about how she wasn’t happy with him and how she still has feelings for me. I said “ You have to chose. Either me or him” she chose me. Or so I thought. A week later I was helping my school with the orientation of the class of 2024. And I didn’t text her Because I took the orientation very seriously. So she was sad. She talked about killing herself because of her mom. And I said meet me at this building on the campus after school. So we did and she kissed me and one thing led to another and I ended up getting some top. The next day she told her friend who told a teacher who told the principal. I was called into the office and 3 cops were there. I froze. And they read me my rights before asking me questions. My vice principal walked in and said “ you have been accused of rape on this campus “ and I cried. I was in that office for hours while the police looked at the security cam footage. They found nothing and dropped the charges. But the school suspended me for 5 days. My mom had received an email talking about me going through an expulsion process. And it would take up to 49 days. Fast forward 49 days and it’s my trial. The school district expelled me from the high school I went back to and sent me back to the school I came from. First day back at school I walked around like Bryce Walker from 13 reasons why. Because everyone thought I was a rapist. I lost all my friends. And lost my mind. I cried for the first week back because everyone would look at me and point fingers. The entire school wanted me dead. I was scared to leave my house. My old friend and my ex are still together. I looked at her twitter page and wanted to follow because I wanted to apologize. All the death threats and suicidal thoughts made it feel like I actually was a rapist. Today I still have nightmares about those events. And it’s crazy how all it took was Deadpool 2 to make me have a mental breakdown and start shaking. I keep getting Snapchat memories of when me and her first met. And I can’t get Christmas and that day I got expelled out of my mind. And to this day I still feel like I’m gonna walk outside and get jumped. And I feel like it’s best if I just kill myself then let others do it',\n",

Something to note is that i'm severely depressed, i've tried to kill myself more times than I care to count, and I think it's turning me into something horrible. My emotions have been a problem since I was young, having been treated to slight physical abuse from my parents. that wasn't that bad to me since it was just my father spanking us a bit too hard, to the point where we'd have bruises. but the real problem came from my older siblings, we'd get into fights, as all siblings do, but the things we did were always violent. my sister would drag her nails down the back of my neck so hard i'd bleed, my brother would hold me down and spit on my face and in my eyes. I've gotten a few scars and besides two that were my own fault, i got them from my family. I don't think they hate me or anything, just that we're a extremely rough family. i've always been a bit more mature than the kids my age (as  narcissistic as that sounds), and i've always thought differently. due to this, the kids around me had always ostricised me as a young child, and later into my life, in the middle school area, i was slightly bullied. child protective services got involved when i was around 10, and they concluded i wasn't abused, and I think they stated that because I was so happy back then. I never talked about bad things, because I loved my family and was smart enough to know that if I told them something like how my brother treats me sometimes they'd take me away. so I left those parts out. lately, after my suicide attempt last year and subsequent stay at a mental hospital for a week, i've been feeling more and more plain. Now keep in mind, my family missed me while i was gone, as i've said i don't think they hate me by any means. but i think i'm slowly losing my love for *them* and everyone around me. I used to be an extremely empathetic person, and would always want to do the right thing. but lately i've been feeling more and more emotionless. when i say this i don't mean i just *don't feel*, i mean i feel for a few seconds and then the feeling goes away, regardless of how hard i want to feel it. I remember when i was thinking about if the people i cared about would kill themselves, how would i feel. i tried imagining them leaving a single message to me, and i could barely bring out tears, and they didn't come out any more. recently my emotions have been going in opposite directions, one day i'll be extremely empathetic, like how i used to be, but a majority of the time i'll be extremely sadistic and enjoy the thought of making another suffer. it's gotten so bad that i can think of killing someone's family right in front of them and get this light feeling in my chest that's similar to joy. just typing that out and thinking about it is giving me a euphoric boost. i'm turning into a monster, and i don't know if i want to stop it, because i'm enjoying it. i *love* the feeling. i know it's most likely a misplaced coping mechanism that has taken a horrible turn but i don't really care, i enjoy it a lot. i can recognize the problems in this writing, and i realize that wanting to rip someone's family away from them is horrible, but i can't help but enjoy the thought. the thought of killing their family right in front of them with a smile and watching them break down crying gives me a sense of euphoria i've never felt before. it's like a high. god i sound like such a serial killer. but yea, that's the gist of it, i'm turning into a sadistic and evil person and i enjoy it. i know that makes me a horrible person, and i agree. i just honestly don't care. i only wanted to write this because i'm in that little mood where i feel extremely emotional and want to get this out.\",\n",

There are things that I think and also think to bring up but I end up not doing so, and just keep them to me. And this leads to a lot of sessions that feel like wasted time  that I didn't learned anything new or something that could help, and appear more akin to small talk rater than therapy.\\n\\nI would like to point out two factor here that make this process difficult to me getting a conclusion.\\n\\n As I said there are things that  I feel ashamed to bring to other people, so this felling might be just me trying to justify that therapy isn't worth to bury those thoughts and feelings, therefore I have a tendency to just try and run away and can't really trust myself for deciding if the therapy is worth or not.  \\n\\nHowever I have serious problem saying no to people, and this problems builds up to a degree that the thought of leaving therapy feel to me that I'm backstabbing my psychologist, her confidence with me and financially.

       " 'Questions about depressed friend.\\n\\nHello. \\nI tried to find something like this but I really didn’t so I made a new post hoping to not bother. So I have this friend (m19) of mine (m16) who I met 5 years ago in League of Legends. Ever since we are pretty good friends with some exceptions. I knew from pretty early one that he had some problems and over the years he opened up about some thinks but I’m still clueless about others and very unsure what to do in certain situations. (I mean I’m just a human too after all, seeking help to not make mistakes around him already seems better than doing nothing, I guess).\\n\\nI myself are not depressed or anything near that. Granted I don’t have any real life friends and not everything is going too well but weirdly enough I am never really sad and in general very happy and optimistic, one could say I kinda love life and living as long as possible. I was just lucky enough to have enough self confidence and a loving mother I would guess.  \\n\\nHe himself doesn’t have any true friends himself in real life, his mother has psychological problems too and his father is a beater (yet not that bad as others, but still even beating sometimes is not okay.) \\n\\nHis brother (who I also have contact too though gaming and messaging) is also depressed but I think more stable and having a girlfriend really helped him too. \\n\\nHe doesn’t really like it at home and often goes out of his way to not be there. His grades are also getting worse. He also talked about suicide and how he would do it to me sometimes. He told me he talked to me about things he did to nobody so I hope I do something right but I am not sure.\\n\\nAfter giving some background that hopefully clears up some stuff I wanted to ask for some advice. Obviously I don’t demand any answers or even answers to all my questions but I would be thankful for it.\\n\\n1.) I have a lot of free time (even before quarantine) and I like to talk a lot with my friends and play games. I know he has a lot of free time too (he told me so often) and spends a lot of time crying and thinking to the wall. I usually text and want to do something and often it takes pretty long to get answers or no at all for some time. What could I do in this scenario ? I am pretty inpatient and often write again hoping to get an answer. I sometimes get kinda mad too since it’s obviously not nice to be ignored even though I know it’s not the best reaction. I just want to spend some time and I think it would be not bad for him too to get some distraction, atleast he seems to enjoy to do stuff together.\\n\\n2.) how do I get him to make own decisions ? I think because I’m pretty confident and direct he is scared sometimes to tell me no or say his opinion and just go with what I want to do or what I say. He told me already he is sometimes scared of me even though I tell him many times he doesn’t have to and I probably would get more annoyed if he just plays for me for the sake of it but doesn’t enjoy it. \\n\\n3.) how to handle if he lies ? Talking with his sister showed a lot of things in other ways than from his perspective? For example he says his mother is really unfair to him, prefers his sister, demands a lot, screams for no reason and never wants to talk with him but his sister said that’s not true or even the other way around. I tried to get him (as good as possible through online friendship) to get a therapist. He said he made an appointment and I just wanted some little proof but he didn’t wanted to do any of that. I just want to make sure he means it this time because his ex girlfriend (who I am also friends with) told me he said this stuff many times and never did it. He also had to change the appointment two times already for whatever reasons. How do I react to that ? When trying to ask and show why It feels like he is lying he always talks it off and so on. \\n\\n4.) How can I push him to get serious help ? I can’t do much myself, especially not online. I know he needs professional help. He knows it too. That’s still far from actually doing it though. Any tips ?\\n\\n5.) Is there anything I can do expect from all the general stuff like listening etc. ? Especially when it comes to his suicide thoughts ?\\n\\nWe wanted to meet this summer and he even told me this promise to meet is the only reason that stops him from killing himself yet. Sadly that won’t work this year since the virus..\\n\\nThanks for everybody who answers or reads this post.',\n",

Warm? There are still all the negative feelings inside me and the looming tasks that I must do. \\n\\nGoing through a break up and filing a police report for my sexual assault is not how i expected this week to go.

Games may seem as foolish or something but I need them. In this quarantine, they're all I have left, my grades are complete shit and it's because of not only this quarantine but the amount of fuck up I hold in my body which I cannot access my games.  My friends and the rare moments my little bro and I bond are the only things keeping me here. I feel like my own parents don't even care yet I've expressed that I feel no need to live. I feel as if life is just a meaningless kick in the balls, everything hurts and everyone looks the other way.\\n\\nThe thing that confuses me in myself is how my life isn't even that bad, most of my worst pain is unintentionally self-inflicted. I don't even know what the hell the thing that's affecting me is. I feel like my life is fine but I don't want it. Every night I go to sleep hoping I don't wake up and then I do wake just go to sleep the same way. During the night is worse than the last, it takes me a while to fall asleep and I end up drowning in my own thoughts I have to try everything just to keep myself from digging into some part of my body with whatever I can find.\\n\\nThe worst part is I'm scared of death, I hate pain but I constantly feel it and I can't fix it. Sometimes I can ignore it but that's rare, I don't know if I'm going to make it past this quarantine but I'm too scared to tell anyone who would care. I'm stuck doing pointless work for a pointless reason for another pointless reason. I'm 15 and I already hate life, I don't even have a job yet, I have barely anything stress me out but here I am. I feel ashamed of everything I do and my mom, my mom of all people makes that worse. I thought mothers were supposed to be there for you, even in your darkest times, she always says wants this amazing unbreakable relationship but does nothing to make it. And it's always because I'm fucking up somehow. whether it's school or simple chores I'm always fucking up and the more I try to fix it the worse I make it. I feel like life is just a game and the rich or the cheaters win. The worst part about dying is the fact that it's so easy to just end it all but so hard to want to stay alive.\",\n",

The first time I attempted suicide I was thirteen, my first bf killed himself and it sent me over the edge, the second time I was sixteen, I honestly don't remember why I tried that time, and the third time was last year after I dropped out of college and did absolutely nothing with my life for several months.

For about a week straight we talked every day about how we would about our feelings and though I went really fast she told me she has real feelings for me and wanted to make it work with me and I felt the same way.

       " \"It's been a couple months since my last depressive episode, I was doing great, I was focusing on school, socializing, (thought) I was patching things up with my family and was generally speaking feeling pretty good about everything. However this pandemic has pulled me all the way back to where I was months ago, all my hard work wasted. I'm scared. I have never been that low before, during those months I had been hospitalized, attempted suicide on multiple occasions and felt nothing except the urge to be gone. I don't want to go back to that, the feeling of complete helplessness, feeling like no matter what I do I can't get out of this hole I'm in, despite wanting to more than ever. I always know that things are going to get better, I know I won't be in this much pain constantly but I don't know if it's worth it. Sure, I'll miss out on things, never get to experience the things my friends will in the future but is it really worth it? Going through months on numbness, pain, sadness when all I get in return is a month or two of feeling okay? I used to want to die while I was happy because I knew in the future I would feel like shit again but of course I could never bring myself to do it because at the time I was content. Anyway, back to the present, I can feel myself slipping back into my old habits now that I am in isolation, self harm, not eating properly etc. I feel like my life is ruined, I can't see a future for myself anymore. I don't want to die but I also don't want to live anymore. Ideally I would just disappear, leave everything, all my responsibilities, family, everything. Start fresh. But I know that's selfish and unfair and wouldn't solve the problem, just put it off until I feel the need to escape again. Isolation has been very difficult for me considering the only things that actually helped was being able to see my friends, since I don't get along with the family I live with. I am now realizing how much I rely on drugs, not only to numb myself but to simultaneously make me feel something. I don't really know what to do. For some reason I have completely isolated myself from all my friends, I don't think I've talked to any of them in about a week (I'm not really sure why to be honest). I really do not get along with my family, for no other reason except the fact that my mother thinks I'm a fuck up, which is completely possible but I believe we jut don't have the same values. I don't know. All I know is that in the end my death is inevitable, it's just a matter of when.\\n\\nSorry my writing is a mess, if you actually read all that, I think I just needed an outlet.\\n\\nAlso I know that as soon as I move out I'll hopefully feel a lot better, my mother is really the cause of, or at least makes my mental health a lot worse however that isn't a possibility as I'm only 16.\\n\\nMy mother knows about my mental health and how bad I'm doing yet refuses to help or even recognize it, despite me being diagnosed as she is worried it will tarnish the family reputation as well as my own. I guess I have a good life, I'm very lucky to be considered attractive, I'm popular, always been selected to be in the highest grade football team, unlike some people on here who complain about being lonely or how they think they deserve are monsters because they have never kissed a girl. No, I know I'm very privileged to be in the position I'm in, I have nothing to complain about, I've had girlfriends all through school as well as doing relatively well in all my classes. Yet somehow, despite the fact that my life is so good I can't find it in myself to be happy. My family thinks everything I do is for attention, my suicide attempts, getting arrested, everything. But it's not. They think that because I have a good life I should be happy and they're right. But I'm not.\\n\\nEdit: If you read this please just say something, anything. I honestly just need some kind of recognition that how I'm feeling is valid.\",\n",
       " 'My SO and I are in a long distance relationship. We each have history with trauma and depression. We’ve been together for almost a year before I finally visited. We both cried and felt heartbroken when I had to go home but two months later I came back for Valentines Day with the intention to stay but it couldn’t have been a worse time for me to leave home. \\n\\nThe day before my flight to my SO, my parents got into a fight after my dogs attacked each other. I have a dog named Mickey, I consider him my best friend because, before I met my SO, every time I’ve had a panic attack due to my ptsd he was the only one who comforted me. Whenever I’d panic in front of my parents they’d just tell me to stop and that I look crazy when I get that way. My stepdad also has a dog named Mango. She used to get along with Mickey who’s a third of her size, but now they just want to attack each other on sight. Actual minutes before I had to leave for my flight, they attacked and Mickey’s head had three gashes. As I cleaned him up, my parents fought and it ended with my mom kicking out my stepdad and Mango. \\n\\nMy stepdad has been arrested multiple times. He’s been envolved with bad people, sold guns, did crack and is still a heavy drinker. He’s threatened my mom before and all those drugs have damaged him to the point where he has schizophrenia. Every other week he rummages through the house trying to find evidence that my mom is either hiding money or hiding other men.\\n\\nI felt incredibly guilty leaving home even though I knew everything would be okay. My mom took Mickey to the vet, even though he’d miss me, he loves my mom just as much. My mom kicking out my stepdad is a regular thing and is usually the kick in the pants he needs to reevaluate his choices and what’s important to him. When he doesn’t let his paranoia get to him, he’s a good caring father for my little brother and sister. But in my head all I thought was, I left my best friend bleeding in my room and my family is broken. \\n\\nOn top of that we have 4 other dogs (one of whom is Mickey’s son and 2 are his grandkids) that have escaped the backyard 3 times so far. And we live close to a busy street and a highway.\\n\\nI arrived at my SO’s house and tried my best to stay calm. I tried my best to trust in my family. I texted my mom and she sent me pictures of Mickey healing up nicely. She also said everything was back to normal with my stepdad and he started working again and he had reinforced our backyard fence. Even with that I still couldn’t let go of my worries. After two weeks, I told my SO I had to go home. I said it was because I wanted to get a job back home bc I’d get paid more here so when I’d come back in June we’d make a down payment on a house. But it was obvious I wanted to go back because I missed my dog.\\n\\nNow Im home and every waking moment I think “I should have stayed”. The fighting between my parents triggers my ptsd, my SO is miserable without me and I’m miserable without my SO. But being able to still see each other over Skype kept us happy, until my SO’s laptop broke. We still call and stay on speaker throughout the day. To cheer ourselves up we made plans for what we’ll do until we’re together again. We looked on Zillow for houses and my SO actually went to got check them out in person and chose one. Now with a goal set I decided I’m gonna stop being sad and make this time in long distance worth it, “I’m going to get a job then come home to my SO and we’ll buy the house we want”. I applied for about 4 different jobs and got an interview for a warehouse job then got to tour the warehouse. But then the pandemic started. I was never told if I was hired or not. I called multiple times, left messages and sent emails but have still not heard a single word from the employer. My SO was also trying to find work but the pandemic was getting worse according to the news and decided its best to wait until quarantine is over. \\n\\nI checked Zillow every day to make sure no one else tried to make an offer for the house even though the realtor assured my SO that no one really wants the house so most likely it would be ready for us when we can afford it. A few days ago I made a birthday wish that we’d own the house, childish I know but I’m a hopeful and sentimental person most of the time. Last night, according to Zillow, someone had made an offer to the realtor and now the sale is pending. When a sale is pending, other offers can be made but my SO and I come from poor families. There’s no way we could make a better offer. We were hoping on waiting for the Stimulus Checks to be enough for a down payment but it looks like someone beat us to it. I’m heartbroken. My SO and I both cried last night and comforted each other over the phone. I said to my SO that maybe the person making the offer will decide not to take the house, there have been other pending sales that stop on Zillow. I said, maybe we’ll find a better house. I don’t really believe that myself. My SO had their heart set on that house and maybe that’s our fault for getting attached to something that could be taken away so easily. \\n\\nThe only thoughts in my head now is “If I stayed, I would’ve had a job, then money for the house by now. If I stayed, my family, my dog would be okay and we’d be happy together. I ruined everything”.',\n",

Maybe that’s why I wanna be in a real relationship to feel that loved I never had. I know that won’t happen I’m really ugly and fat. That’s maybe why I wanna get cosmetic surgery. To boost my confidence. Going to school hearing from my case manager saying that I won’t succeed if I stay in that English class. Walking through school trying to be happy and laughing for a few seconds, but then later on feel being judged. Always getting home tired from a long day of school. Just the same thing everyday. I wanna finish my high school and move to Korea, being able to go college there. Maybe going on dates, going out with friends. But I need to get a job but I don’t know how to. I feel like people are annoyed by me. I feel like I’m a burden to everyone. Last school being told before getting out of special Ed a teacher saying I’m just lazy and I won’t get out. Maybe their right I am useless. I always here the same thing your caring, kind, brave, funny. But what’s going on the inside of me. I’ve always wanted to go to a concert just to have an experience, but more specifically that I want to go bts, them singing their love yourself album. Me hoping being able to marry rm from bts. But will this happen. Am I even good enough. Wishing having a live like a Kdrama. Having a happy ending but will I ever have one. I’ve kinda dated people the first one Chris, he was my first bf, we only dated for a week. I cheated on him with a guy, this guy wanted nudes so I sent them cause it felt good being called pretty, hot, good looking. Chris also wanted nudes so I did send them to him, I was very uncomfortable. He said he would love me if I did and so did the other guy did too. I tried to apologize to him. I even made accounts just so he could forgive me. So I didn’t have to feel guilty or disgusting of myself. The 2nd I dated a girl, I was maybe was curious but tbh I just wanted love and affection. She though would start calling me horrible names just as fat, ugly, disgusting, slut, hoe. We were off and on I guess we tried to get back together, I kept begging cause I needed someone to talk to. Soon after we dated for 2 more weeks, she ended with me. Saying I never loved you. The third on me and him dated for a month he kept asking for nudes I did not send him any, I felt uncomfortable. He sent a message saying I only wanted nudes from you but you didn’t give me any, also he said how much he liked me. He broke it off. The next one she well we dated for 3 month but I never felt that connection or feeling I kinda of liked how she’d complimented me. Also I’ve never received any attention. No one really has ever said oh wow your so beauty to me in real life. Maybe that’s why I’m obsessed with guys cause I want a guy that’s good looking telling me I’m attractive. But I know that won’t happen. Bts came along rm has taught me to not feel no more guilty of how I used to. I’ve attempted suicide but it didn’t work. I sound crazy but sometimes I think I wanna go to a mental health hospital just to get away from the world.',\n",
       " 'When I was a freshman in high school, I got in trouble for lying to my mom about where I was. She sat me down and talked to me, and I bawled because I thought of myself as a disappointment from then on. I don’t like being in trouble. I told her I was depressed and wanting to commit suicide. It wasn’t the best timing, but I was hoping she would try to get me into some sort of program so I don’t do anything else to further tarnish my relationships. She told me I was lying. The next day I packed up some of my things and asked my parents to drive me to the hospital so I could be admitted (I was stupid and had only seen mental institutions on TV). My father said that there was no reason for me to go because I wasn’t in crisis. I wanted to kill myself and I had tried many times, but I wasn’t in crisis? From that day forward, I never spoke to my parents about my depression or wanting to end my life. When I had come clean about being sexually abused by a family member, my mother told me that I had to tell my therapist I was lying to protect the family image. Because of this, I’ve been unable to change my antidepressant prescription for months, even though I am having suicidal thoughts and my appetite fluctuates. I don’t want to be seen as a liar since I’ve been called one so many times. I try to make their lives better, but all I get back in return is being too scared to say anything serious to them for fear of being punished or yelled at. I’m terrified of them. I won’t ask my friends to hang out most of the time because I’m too scared to ask them. They scare the shit out of me. I want to die or just go away, but it’s so hard. It’s so hard.',\n",

       " 'I have always been depressed since I was a kid. I grew up on a small reservation seeing a lot of drug abuse and alcoholics. It hurt worse seeing my own mom run away from her problems and use drugs and same for my father but with alcohol. I never had someone to look up to so I gained a lot of bad habits from my mom as I mostly lived with her for most of my life. I’ve always felt I’ve realized how cruel the world could be since I was young. I grew into this why should I care when no one else around me does. I mean I seen my reservation get trashed with bottles, I’ve seen people all fucked up off meth as almost everyone was on it, and I’ve seen my mom get beat up by her boyfriends and her brothers just laugh about it.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nNo one around me cares so why should I? This mindset followed me for awhile, I was deeply depressed until I met my ex girlfriend in 2015. I always seen her in high school but never seen her as someone I would have thought I liked. We met one day after a basketball game and we just hit things off. And for once in my life things actually felt ok I had a reason to live again I met someone with pure intentions and someone who actually loved me for me. After we started dating she showed me a different person that I wanted to be.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nI really wanted it to happen but i was constantly getting challenged with hardships. My dads sister passed away in a car crash and she left behind her 4 kids she was starting to become someone I looked up to then one day she was just gone. I was mad at god cause my thought was how can you take a mother of 4 kids and leave them with my grandmother who was dying. I started drinking and smoking more. These habits caused a lot of bad things between our relationship. She wanted me to stop drinking but I couldn’t I liked getting numb I liked not thinking about the problems even tho it wasn’t my worry but I cared to deeply to not worry.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nIt’s especially shitty cause I was living with my dad at the time but he didn’t care if I drank and partied so I was doing it all the time. Some days I’d get off school and me and my friend would buy a pint sometimes day after day on school nights his continued for a while until my dad left to rapid to be with my younger sisters. I was left at home with my dads brother who would come back drunk and always try to fight me. My ex offered me a place to live but I never really accepted it. I’d spend the night or a couple days sometimes but always felt like a burden for accepting the offer to stay.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThis continued for a long time I was still happy with her. Things were ok again after I finally accepted to live with her I no longer had to deal with all these toxic people in my life things were good again I was happy again. We had a good relationship until a girl I use to like finally decided to have feelings for me I chased her for years so I didn’t know how to deal with it. Me and my ex went to prom and she didn’t like to drink then so I was the only one who went out after prom with friends I got drunk and my dumbass started flirting with the girl.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nShe ended up finding out and this where a good things just started slowing going downhill we argued about stupid things more. I grew up seeing my mom screaming and fighting at her boyfriends so it makes me sick to think I use to act just like that. But even after all the bad we was always there for each other in the end. I lost my grandma and I literally lost it this woman took care of me when my mom wasn’t there. She was literally my mom and she called me son. I lost my shit I got drunk and cried. I even went to see her a day before they was gonna pull the plug drunk surprised the hospital even let me in but I think they took pity to let me see her.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nI cried to her all by myself and told her I would stop drinking and smoking and take care of the kids. I slept in the lobby and the next day I was distant i didn’t know what to say anymore I wasn’t ready to let her go. I couldn’t stay with her as they took the breathing machine I wasn’t strong enough. After the funeral I was drinking hard. It’s became a ugly habit and I was ruining things more by not handling my emotions I became more distant and stopped telling my ex about everything I started hating the world. I took a break from us cause I knew I was putting a lot of pressure on her she had her own problems and here she was dealing with all of mine.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nI left her cause I hated hurting her, it made me feel like a monster. As I felt through all these emotions I thought my way of doing it,was the way to handle it. I moved in with my mom for awhile and I dealt with her toxic attitude it really made me question am I gonna be like my parents or am I gonna be someone my ex made me feel like I wanted to be. We started talking again but I hurt her when I left I knew she didn’t understood but I was scared of hurting her anymore.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWe ended up working things out and we both decided to go to college. We was going to class together everyday and things were once again back to normal only problem now was her household her aunties were bad on meth and they became a problem for our relationship but nothing to serious. One day we was watching a movie and we heard someone drop in the kitchen she goes to check and I hear her start crying. I go to look and she one auntie sitting on a chair with her head tilt back not conscious and the other laying down on the floor everyone starts freaking out and I remember seeing auntie #2s kids start screaming cause they see there mom lifeless on the floor I chase everyone out and have my ex’s mom call 911 and I start to preform cpr.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThis felt like the longest 15 minutes of my life. Everyone is coming in and out of the kitchen screaming and I’m sitting on the ground trying to get air in her system. She’s getting more and more purple. I’m freaking out cause the aunt on the chair wakes up but doesn’t realize that her sister is on the ground literally dying. I get mad slap her in the face and force her face to look at the ground. Her first response was “what happened.” I was mad freaking out cause she literally supplied the drugs. I go back to the cpr and finally she wakes up and she starts crying.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMy ex’s mom was is yelling at her for being dumb. I go outside and start chain smoking cigarettes cause my anxiety is through the roof. I call my mom and cry tell her to stop doing drugs. She says she ain’t but I know she’s lying. But it felt good to have her comfort me. After that day I grew an anxiety that felt worse day by day I started having ptsd and always seen her purple face in the back of my mind. I stopped focusing on school and failed a class. I lost funding and was lost. This when she really started to give up on me. I assumed cause I started to give up on myself.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nShe warned me and I really felt her done with me. She told me she fell for someone else and I begged for one last chance. She gave it to me, I started to workout everyday I prayed to a god and forgave him I even went to therapy even though I don’t believe in therapists things felt back on track and she said told me things like “were meant to be.” And “I swear your my soulmate.” And it helped not to worry about the guy who I thought of as a friend that liked her. Things were good but he was always in the picture. I even told her that if she wanted to choose him just do it I’ll more than willingly leave.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nBut she said no she wanted me. So I believed her until I found out she was hanging out with him behind my back. That really broke me and I just got drunk and wanted to kill myself. Everything I was working on went back to where I started I left my hometown cut off a lot of friends and just been drowning myself in liquor and drugs and as much as I don’t want to I do it anyway I feel myself becoming my mother everyday. The messed up part about all this is I would still go back to her in an instant cause even though I’ve been forcing myself to hate her I still love her :(',\n",

If any guy even speaks with me that means he/she has some work with me and later they just ignore.... How much ever I care about people they don't give a fuck about me unless they have some thing that i have to do for them...

For those of you whose problems are physical abuse or shortage of money for food, Im sorry that this is going to sound like a rant compared to your problems.\\n\\nIts one week into lockdown, and Im getting verbally abused by my mum literally almost everyday, telling me im worthless.

Whenever living in school, I would just drink my problems away. Would love to drink my problems away now except my parents ban me from drinking ever since I've come of age, no valid reason, just cause im a girl. Despite my brother being able to drink until he is completely drunk before he gets home in the middle of the night so often.

       " 'According to everyone, I have so much going for me. I have a wealthy house and I’m in college doing okayish. I have “friends” like I’m not a complete loner... , and I’m not a complete loser, people like me because I am a funny guy. I am overall doing okay. But for the longest time, I would say the last 8 or 9 years, I have this existential dread always lingering. I feel like everyone’s life is more upward-sloping but mine has been in constant decline. \\n\\nI’m about to turn 20. I’m in college and miserable because I’m studying for a degree I am not interested in. I’m not interested in anything anymore really. I used to think I could be a writer or a painter or something in fashion and that was my calling, but every attempt at those things I just get so frustrated because I suck at it. I just can’t ever have a complete project to call my own and show everyone and be proud of it. I’m sitting on a bunch of half done art pieces, music loops not finished and a lot of clothes I bought to put my own designs on, sitting in my closet. I feel like I am to late to be great at something brand new. Now I find pleasure and happiness in nothing anymore. \\n\\nAs I get older I realize all the friends I have made recently are slowly dwindling away moving on in life. I can’t make those deep friendships anymore because I feel like no one I know actually wants to ever see or talk to me, even before this whole virus shit. The only way I get peoples attention is being funny. But being funny has really become a coping mechanism lately. When I was a lot younger, I would get super nervous around most people and resort to humor to break ice. Now i try to be funny all the time to make people like me, but now nobody really wants to get to know me beyond surface level bullshit that you would consider small talk. I can’t think of any of my friends who even know when my birthday is. I really feel alone.\\n\\nThen my family. They all really care about me, but any discussion about what I want to do with my life always turns ugly. Because I don’t know what I want anymore. I thought I did, but I can never motivate myself to do anything. I get surges of energy and then it’s gone for a long time. That’s how my life feels, waves of inspiration and the motivation to do something, then it’s gone. It always leaves so quickly. I think the worse thing is my parents never check on how I am mentally. They just complain that I don’t have a life goal like they do, and remind me that I need to figure shit out quick. I don’t think they have bad intentions, but I feel like my life priorities are so much different then theirs sometimes.\\n\\nNow here’s my biggest complaint. Every day, I feel like I am in a loop of bullshit. I eat, I work really hard to get As in school (this is the only reason my parents don’t just kick me out already because I am doing well in academics), then after I’ll once again pop an Adderall, waste time on some bullshit design or play around on FL and make some awful shit, get pissed and go to bed. That’s been my life the past couple years. I feel like I live two lives, one as a slave to bullshit I don’t care about at all, and me making an honest attempt at what I think I would love, and utterly failing. Both lives are reminders at how miserable I truly feel inside, and I go to bed feeling like that. I don’t really dream at all anymore, and I wake up so late for no reason.\\n\\nToday I really was at my end. I just kept thinking about how much of a failure I am, I sat on my second story windowsill and really thought about jumping. I think the biggest reason I never go through with self harm or suicide is because I know I haven’t done anything with my life yet, and I cling to the possibility that there is something for me. But every day it gets a little smaller, and it’s been shrinking for years.\\n\\nI think what really makes all of this shit bad is I don’t tell anyone about these thoughts or whatever it’s called. I hate thinking I’m depressed but I feel like I might be, despite what everyone thinks about me. I don’t know who to turn to anymore, to just sit down with someone and get everything off my chest. Because I really feel like anything I do or say to anyone, it just doesn’t matter. Nothing changes, I’m still stuck in this daily loop that I mentioned earlier. I feel very alone. At the same time I am scared of changes, and I don’t know why. I used to think I was special, that the things I would do or say matter, but as I get older I just realize how unspecial I truly am. I really hope someone reads all of this.',\n",

They crafted little sheets of sticky notes with handwritten messages and stuck them on lockers and handed them to students. Everyone got different messages and my friends all got things like \"you look beautiful today\". Some of them got longer sentences and varies things in attempt to cheer them up, but what I got was simply 2 words- \"you matter <3\". I almost cried. I knew those were handed out randomly and most of my friends just brushed these notes off but I felt so relieved looking at that note. It was such a simple phrase but it meant the world to me.

I do, however, have some nervousness about meeting new people or being in large crowds, but I think that's normal. \\n\\nFor the last year, I've primarily been shut at home. I was studying for an engineering exam, which I passed thankfully! But a side effect was that I became a little rusty socially. I'm not horrible, just a little off (I think). Or maybe it's a skill I never developed. Whenever I hear friends talking about their social lives, I get a little jealous. I don't have many friends - just a handful. When I hear how people make new friends so easily, I think that something must be wrong with me. My logic is that I must have some characteristic/attitude that is pushing people away\\n\\nThis is where I'm at. I'm not super depressed as I was yesterday. I'm working and keeping my mind occupied. Overall, my mood has been elevated, though I have to wonder why pot made me depressed.\\n\\nTL:DR: Smoked pot and started having thoughts about why I have no friends LOL\",\n",

Please, avoid this if it’s absolutely triggering or uncomfortable for you to read! Know your limits. If you need help and support you can reach out through trusted social connections or hotline supports and websites about it depending where you live. \\n\\nSorry if this isn’t a well developed text post. \\n\\n         This question prompted to me in my head during my conversation with a friend of mine. My friend had brought news that a local had took their own life. \\nOf course, we both found this devastating. \\nDespite not knowing this person, I’m still very upset on what has happened.\\n\\nMy mind was already brainstorming (why did they kill themselves, where did it all go wrong for them, and everything). \\nI was just trying to think of all the factors and reason and what contributed to their suicide. I’m also somebody with a suicidal mindset (I’m trying to recover dw about me) but the others’ minds and experience intrigue me. \\n\\nOf course, as somebody keen in investigating truths and the connections that revolve around questions, I asked for more details about it. Hoping for information such as their background, history, identity or even a suicide note.\\nUnfortunately, my friend didn’t hear anything else. \\n\\nThen my friend proceeds to say, “Those people are weak”. \\nThe atmosphere changed between us, I don’t think the other person noticed that. But I was really conflicted with that comment and the way they said it. \\nHonestly, the tone was a little insensitive. \\nI tried to not to misinterpret that (in avoidance of conflict for misunderstanding), but it still bothers me. \\n\\nI further questioned them to elaborate with “why do you think they’re weak?” \\n\\nThey said, “They’re people in much more unfortunate situations.” By unfortunate situations, this is implying people in situations without the the basic necessities of living like a shelter, water or food etc. I knew what they were implying bc this person usually talks about this phrase in the terms of third world country situations. Nevertheless, this is in contrast to the suicide victim that lived in a first world country with basic necessities. \\n“Those people have less than what that dead person has, and yet they’re not killing themselves.” \\nYes, that’s true in terms of basic physical necessity for our bodies but I felt that it wasn’t about that.\\n\\nThen I pointed out, “I think we need to consider the psychological mindset they were in, not just what they physically had. Those people may be lacking something else for their wellbeing that is crucial to sustain their will to live.” \\n\\nMy friend, again, didn’t wanna jump on board with that thought. I don’t think my friend understands that you can’t blame people for adopting this mindset and desire, no one started out l this way. \\n\\nMore irrelevant discussions followed after that however I left in the middle of tight tension. Too long too type out what happened.\\nAt the end, we were both annoyed with each other about the topic. \\n\\nI’m not saying their argument was invalid, I understand where they were coming from, but we could’ve gone better if they could have considered the points I made. \\n\\n       I hope you guys understand on what I was trying to point out. \\nObviously, I can’t justify who’s right in this situation or if there is even a right answer. So I’m wondering what’s your opinion on the given question? Maybe your responses can help broaden my understanding on these things. \\n\\nTL;DR: I was in a basic conversation with this friend. Then my friend breaks the news that a local committed suicide. \\nMy friend comments on their contention that people who have desire towards suicide in first world countries are weak in comparison to people in third world countries. Pointing it out that those people should not have a reason to kill themselves anyways — calling it out on the contention that is selfish and pathetic. We got annoyed with each other at the end. I still feel need closure to this question. \\n\\n      I found it upsetting on what they were saying but again I’m still not completely against with everything they said. I know we both agreed that suicide wasn’t a good thing, but it was the way they thought about suicidal people. Again, it’s a heavy topic that the answer differs to everybody. I’m willing to be open minded. And so I’m wondering what’s your opinion on the given question?',\n",

I was the oldest, and she had younger kids. But she kept all her attention on me, and because of that my brother almost got hit by a fucking car, he was 5. My adoptive moms friend ran to get him before it happend.( I love her for what she did). It was during one of our meetings ( I had been taken out of my birth moms house). My birth mom is terrible. She would leave me and my siblings on peoples porches, who knows what those people did to us. And she would go out to drink while we were at those random peoples houses. She tried to kill my sisters dad, right in front of us. We suffered PTSD because of the things she did to us.

My cousin has issues. so when I started screaming and my auntie caught him, I got in trouble by her because I told her he was hurting me. She never told anyone, and because I got in trouble, I thought it was my fault so I didnt tell anyone ether. Now I still have to see him. I flinch every time he hugs me or kisses me on the cheek. It makes me sick, and turns my stomach.\\n\\nMy adoptive mom later had two boys. One is 8 and the other is 6. I hate them both, but I hate the 8 year old one more. Im a terrible sister and a burden to everyone who knows me. Im annoying and when people ditch me I go crawling back to them like some pathetic dog. Even if it was never my fault. Im always apologizing to people and it annoys the shit out of them. Im emotionally unstable, have terrible anger issues, and really bad mood swings. Im suicidal and have 3 failed attempts.

       " \" Hi all,\\n\\nI just wanna get some things off my chest. I don't know if I have depression, but I don't want to ask my parents to take me to a counsellor or therapist etc. Basically, when I was in Year 7 I started having little depressive periods, which were uncommon and lasted for about a day. In Year 8, it increased, but was still not major. I would usually feel depressed because I felt bad that i was living a good life while others in the world aren't, and would start to fear dying and losing ones I love. I also later started to see that life is worthless and nothing matters. In Year 9 however, it became much worse. I started slitting my wrists because I hate myself, I feel bad because I only care for myself and I look back on past events of my life and regret a lot of things. I feel like I deserve pain. I also came out as bisexual to close friends and my mum, and I feel everything has changed - I've started to fear and hate change and I fear the future. I don't want to grow up, because I can never go back, and I take one step closer to death. I feel really confused, and have racing thoughts about my feelings that usually contradict themselves. I dunno, its so hard to fully explain how I feel. I don't like myself, and I fantasise about living a different life even though I have so many great friends now. I've recently made a bunch of friends of instagram on a group chat, as we all really like South Park. I feel I've become really close to them, and just knowing that one day we'll probably stop talking to each other and we'll go our separate ways (the same applies to friends at school). I've been feeling down everyday, and feel I've lost quite a lot of energy. I feel that I might have become more irritable and a lot of the time, when with family, I always want to walk away and be by myself. Everyday I always have thoughts of gloom and fear that overshadow the great things in life. I'm not suicidal but to be honest I feel I would be better off dead sometimes. It's confusing, and I feel like I can't explain all of my problems. Slitting my wrists makes me feel better, but then again sometimes I feel like I attention seek by doing stuff like that, and talking about my feelings, and that therefore I'm a toxic person. One thing that's been bothering me a lot is the thought that being depressed doesnt matter as there are billions of humans on this planet alone - I dont matter and my feelings dont matter. What's the point of life?\\n\\nI cant explain how i feel fully, but I've tried. I don't know if i have depression, or if its all just nothing. I feel that when i get older, ill ignore all of the pain of life and live the rest of my days being worthless to society. The thoughts keep racing through my head, and i try to think of whats bothering me but it just gets worse. Everyday I feel I'm wasting my valuable childhood and fear the passing of time.\\n\\nSorry for the rant, I just wanted to see if i could put my emotions into words.\\n\\nThanks guys.\",\n",

I have a very hard time opening up to people because of past experiences I have im very distrustful of those around me even my friends and family not completely unjustified I assure you dear reader but I admit I feel like I can’t trust anyone so I can’t speak on how I feel because I’m certain no one around me cares or really know what to do with me the only reason I’m posting this here is because none of you know who I am so I’ll begin.I’m a 20m below average in terms of both looks and intelligence currently lied off from work dew to covid-19 and I feel my ambition outweighs my talent so all in all a pretty pointless person. Honestly I’ve felt that about myself my entire life but for the past year I’ve felt only a slow decline from that point down to such a point I don’t know what to do . What were most of you doing on Valentine’s Day of this year, enjoying the company of loved ones I hope, my ‘best friend’ read from a notebook about how much I wanted to kill myself. I’ve considered killing my self for a good while I’m not sure why I haven’t yet really I live at home with fairly easy access to firearms so it’s wouldn’t be particularly difficult but yet I don’t or at least I haven’t made my final decision but I doubt someone like me will be missed you want to know what the worst feeling I get about all this ? It’s the fact I want to kill my self doesn’t bother me the idea of death doesn’t scare me and just the general feeling of apathy for myself there’s something wrong with me that could mean the end of my life and I don’t care I wouldn’t wish this on anyone I admit I haven’t always been a good person I’m human I can selfish and greedy I’ve hurt people who didn’t deserve it so the way I am isn’t completely without fault of my own and in some ways I probably deserve it too and I’m not looking for sympathy because poor me life soooo hard and I just can’t cope how sickening but I appreciate those who would be kind enough to say words of encouragement but don’t waste your time I’m not here for me I could care less about me I’m probably to far gone to be helped at this point I’m writing this in the vain hope that someone who might feel the same way I do sees this and doesn’t want to end up like this pathetic human bitching online I just want to say for most of you there’s still hope for you reach out because if you don’t you might not ever and you might end up like me a pathetic loser who’s better off dead I hope at least one person sees this and realize it’s not to late well that’s all I really have to say I hope you all stay safe and happy',\n",

Be someone I always wanted to be. Great right? I got a personal trainer, (because my self worth/happiness seemed to be tied to my weight and how I look. I know it's wrong, but it's something I can't seem to change. When I look good, I feel good). I got a nutritionist to show me how to have a better relationship with food, I went out more, had a stable paycheck finally, and took care of myself. Then I started to date with really great guy.

I’m in medical billing (3rd Party Biller) and it’s more stressful than it has ever been, but all the people assigned to help me normally are overseas and with India on lockdown with no offices open I’m working alone with no support. Things are falling apart. I’m being crushed by my management and the client. At this point I’m ready to just get fired and collect the unemployment because each day is a new hell. My hobby is portrait photography and I can’t participate in it because of the outbreak. I don’t feel like I can do this much longer. I’m losing my mind and I hate each day. Work is the first thing I think of when I wake up, the last thing I think of when I go to sleep, and the subject of most my dreams.',\n",

       " 'This is really just for me to vent seeing as no matter how hard i look, there is nothing that makes me happy so get your popcorn cause I realize now after typing, this is a long one.\\n\\nJust as the MANY people ive seen on here, im just another sad man trying to get this all off his mind since talking about it tends to make things better. I dont think im depressed in the sense there is something in my brain making me sad, instead it IS my brain thats making me sad. I have no interest in relationships since ive had bad experiences and now truly i understand them to be a waste of time and just another reason ill kill myself in the future. My whole life ive been called “lazy” to the point i started believing it but really, im just always bored. I have terrible memory so trying to remember how i was in the past is hard but from what i know today...I. Hate. Work.\\n\\nAnd i dont mean a job or cleaning, i mean i hate having to put effort into everything since its so meaningless. Im 19 and have the ability to do anything yet id rather die. I truly believe if i cared enough, i could rule the world. I study astrophysics, or atleast try, and in the field you work HARD. Something i cannot do easily. With it, you start to learn where we came from and where we’re going. I loved it up until around 24hrs ago and idk what changed but it was one of the only things keeping me going. Lemme just be a spoiler real quick...everything was born from dust and everything will die as dust. With that in mind, why work so hard when no matter how we try eventually the universe will go dark and every material thing will end. Id rather die then continue to wake up, eat, shit, sleep, repeat.\\n\\nMy mind has developed a good, very unhealthy, defense mechanism. Thinking about sad stuff makes me depressed for a bit but after a good 5 mins, its like someone built a brick wall around that thought. I forget about it and it feels like how you close your ears and yell in order to not hear spoilers at a movie. Every now and then itll come seeping through the cracks but that someone just puts duct tape over it and its good as new...until i start thinking about it again, then it repeats. At this point...it just looks like a 3 inch thick wall of duct tape...\\n\\nIve read it all before. “It could always be worse” it literally cannot when everything is on the exact same timer thats counting down. “You find meaning in life” if thats true why arent we born taught that instead of being taught that “this is life and you’re here without a choice so start working and don’t question if theres a better way”. Here’s another spoiler you’ve probably already figured out. By the time you retire youll be so used up that all the money youve saved will go to keeping you alive unless you’re famous then you can retire at 30 and the world will continue looking up to you for no logical reason other then you’re what we all want to be.\\n\\nThis should really be on r/suicidewatch but its not like that has ever helped anyone that was truly unhappy. The only thing keeping me going are these primitive emotions towards my family who would be destroyed if I finally ended it all. I don’t deserve this life. These human emotions make me want to care about people but i really dont want them to care about me and i dont know why. Maybe so one day when i take the easy way out i can do it without worrying about what i leave behind. I fucking hate these emotions they just hold me back i wish i was a sociopath. I want everyone to just stop caring and just leave me alone forever.\\n\\nFrom an early age we have this idea that death is something you shouldn’t want and that life is all about not dying which is understandable, its in every living things code to stay alive and reproduce but we put a “civilized” look on it since living is all we know. Truly i welcome death and cant wait to find out whats on the other side. “Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood...” -Marie Curie\\n\\nIve had drug problems but its only been weed. The real problem was realizing i needed weed in order to be happy and thats just a step under being on antidepressants and at that point they might as well tell me the Earth is flat since the world is an illusion when you’re high on drugs. Everyone just thinks they’re a doctor or a therapist and tries to tell you whats wrong with you but how can another human really know your mind better then you. Therapist are specifically trained to do so but really they’re going off of a book that categorizes you into a group with the other million people that are slightly similar. But theyll never 100% understand your mental process. Thats your job and i now see that ill never change and that living life im short happy sequences is the only way ill live passed 20. Shit that might be the only way anyone lives if you really think about it. But really what do i know, im a regular first year college student with one semesters worth of psychology knowledge \\n\\nHoly shit i didn’t realize how much I’ve rambled....If you’ve reached this far, wow. You’re either bored as shit or just like me, looking for some other person to be able to connect this emotion with. Whatever it is you actually read this so really, thank you. I’ve never been able to really connect with people on this topic and this is the only way i can talk about this. Everyone who i talk to about it either thinks I’m depressed or just insane or doesn’t even know how to help(i cant blame them) and some are just too stupid to let go of this idea life has meaning.\\nAll my friends and family mean well, but its not something i want to burden them with cause not only will they not understand, they’ll feel morally obligated to intervene which will make me hate them. From what I’ve seen, im not special. Thousands, if not millions, have the same feeling and some get to live happy lives after awhile while the rest aren’t around anymore. Im still fighting in my head which side i want to choose but really just typing this makes me feel slightly better. Thank you for coming to my TED talk',\n",
       " 'Me and my ex boyfriend broke up August of last year. It eventually became a mutual thing and we became absolute best friends, like it was before we started dating.

I’ve known her the whole 4 years we were together and i loved her like my own grandmother. Bonded with her as if i was her own grandchild so this is hitting me as if she were my biological grandmother. \\n\\nThe reason I feel this is so difficult is because I’m trying my hardest to not make this about me because it’s really not. It’s about his immediate family and their grieving process. I don’t want to make it seem like my feelings are more important than theirs. But it’s so hard. All i want to do is cry when i talk to his mom but i feel like i can’t because this was her MOTHER and I’m just someone who’s been here a short amount of time(we are also still VERY close. We talk on a weekly basis) \\n\\nAnother reason this is kind of difficult to process is because me and my ex want to be there for each other like we use to be but we know that we can’t because we’re both in other relationships and we feel like they wouldn’t like the idea of us grieving together, even tho they both know we’re strictly just friends. So there’s that. \\n\\nI’m currently at work just extremely overwhelmed with all of this and I just can’t stop crying.

       " 'Tonight I drank 2 beers and a glass of wine. I also had two puffs of weed. I feel like this is pathetic behavior on my part, especially given my age (mid-40s).\\n\\nBut...I moved across the country almost 2 years ago, I still don’t have any friends in this area (I mean no one to hang out with—just acquaintances, and I’m single). I was married til my late 30s, and because my marriage was mutually abusive and dysfunctional (NOT due to drinking or anything tho—it was just a bad match), I was in an unhealthy state of mind, and this is a big reason why I ended up becoming isolated from many of my friends, I believe. By that point, I had grown up responsibilities which got in the way of making close friends to replace them. It’s hard to make intimate friends as an adult, for me anyway. \\n\\nI’ve been lonely for years. Dating and short-lived flings—no real relationships sadly—have just been diversions or distractions or another trigger for depression. \\n\\nSo I’m incurably lonely, I guess, and I’ve been depressed for many years, most of my life really, almost continuously since I was a teenager. Its funny—in my 20s and 30s, I never really liked alcohol much. I had a couple bad experiences when I got sick from drinking, and that turned me off. \\n\\nBut ever since about my mid to late 30s, once in a while, I do drink, and drinking just makes me feel better sometimes—more relaxed maybe, more accepting  of my emotions, rather than judging them or pushing them down. I also go for weeks, sometimes months, at a time during which I don’t drink. This is because sometimes I get nervous I’m overdoing it and I do force myself to abstain. In periods when I’m drinking, I usually drink 2-4 glasses of wine OR 2-3 beers (it was an odd thing for me tonight that I mixed), always in the evening, 3-5 days a week. I know that’s a lot—a doctor would say too much.\\n\\nOnce or twice a month, I also smoke pot, tho always just a couple puffs because I’m inclined to get paranoid when stoned, and that’s just very unpleasant. But sometimes when I’m high I feel creative and my senses are keener.\\n\\nI guess my question is...is this so bad? Is drinking really and truly inadvisable for depressives? What if once in a while, it helps me to feel alive and somewhat better at least for a few hours or a couple days? I know it’s a form of self-medicating or whatever. But I kind of believe in self-medicating about as much as real, doctor-prescribed antidepressants...that is to say...not much, but if it helps people get thru the day, and there aren’t negative repercussions, maybe it’s a positive thing...maybe it’s fine.\\n\\nTLDR: Is alcohol really that bad for people with depression, if it’s not being used to extremes? What about pot? I use both sometimes in light to moderate amounts, and it’s my way of having fun and enjoying the ways I entertain myself (mainly walking or listening to music and podcasts and cooking).

He has an IPhone so the social worker had been face-timing his family everyday for him so he would not spend his last days alone. Over the weekend, I offered to come in an hour early and sit with him. This way he could continue to talk to them and have someone to sit with.

I sat in my car after work last night and cried for the first time in about a year. \\n\\nI truly just don\\'t know how much more of this I can take.

My capstone, which I\\'m scheduled to take in the Fall and is required to graduate, is to take part in the production of a public-access show. Guess what?

As a result of my \"cushy\" financial situation, I am ineligible for a stimulus check and have to resort to mooching off my parents. I know I wasn\\'t going to be making 50k a year out of college with this degree, but I expected to be in something better than wageslave retail or unreliable gig/contract work. This pandemic is making me rethink every decision I\\'ve ever made about college and how they were all wrong.

(That pissed me off a bit) \\n\\nShe would always make comments on how ‘Raven’ (the emo depressed character) was like her. \\nIn my head in like: EXCUSE YOU?!

So im more than certain i would\\'ve done so much if i hadnt ended up this way. The only reason i never realized i was bullied is because i was told it was my fault and no one defended me, so instead of understanding i had social anxiety, to me it made perfect sense that a \"horrible person\" would be afraid to express themselves to other people as they \"rightfully should\" as well as i didn\\'t know what bullying was growing up. \\n\\nNow i feel like things i wanted to do the people my age are too mature for that  and it makes me depressed that others went through necessary milestones that i didnt and now we cant authentically interact without them seeing me as immature or me feeling like im talking to someone beyond my level of maturity.

       " 'So I’ve been debating posting here for a while. I’ve lurked various subreddits and idk if this will do any good but here i am. I don’t really have any other options so maybe venting here will help. I’m 19 and I’ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts for a long time now. I remember being around 11 or 12 and telling my mom “sometimes I just wanna put a gun to my head”. To be fair, looking back maybe I was just being a dramatic 12 year old but there was definite truth to that statement deep down. I’m not gonna get into my whole life story here as if it will explain why my brain works the way it does. Because to be honest my upbringing probably didn’t help but I’m pretty sure this is just how my mind functions regardless of how my life is going and there’s nothing I can do about it. \\n\\nI can’t really remember the last time I felt happy. I don’t even know if I ever have. Or if I have, I don’t remember what that is supposed to feel like. I have 2 modes. I either feel so much pain my chest aches or I don’t feel anything at all, even if I try to make myself. I’m tired of being alive. I don’t want anyones messages about how oh it gets better or oh here’s what you should do because trust me I’ve tried just about everything to distract myself. Most days I can barely get out of bed and I don’t eat much. Most I do is drink too much coffee because it at least gives me some energy, if i drink enough of it. But honestly usually that doesn’t even work, it just makes me jittery. \\n\\nOn the daily, suicide is all I can think about. When I’m eating, when I’m driving, when I’m watching tv or whatever mundane tasks I engage in my mind is just yelling at me to kill myself. And honestly maybe I should. There’s nothing good going for me. I graduated and now I have no job no life plan and I aint doin shit except wallowing in my depression because I don’t have energy for anything else that might be more eventful. \\n\\nWhen I think about my future plans, even if I’m thinking positively, I still see the end game being my death by suicide. I feel its just inevitable. It’s how I’m gonna go. In fact even when I am having a ‘good’ day, good as I should be having fun I can’t enjoy any of it, so really what’s the point? I’ve went through all the options in my head of how and when I could do it, what would be the right time if there even is one and what carrying out said task would consist of and what preperations I would need to make. I even have a top 5 ways I would probably kill myself, the first being I won’t literally say it here but you get my point. \\n\\nMaybe life is msaningful maybe it isn’t. I obviously don’t have all the answers. Maybe a lot of you think I should ride this out because it’s the right thing to do or because you think suicide is selfish. I don’t. Why should I suffer constantly everyday for the possible benefit of someone else? If someone does give a shit, they definitely haven’t told me about it. I spend most of my days alone since I feel like relationships are pointless at this point and I don’t make an effort to keep anyone in my life for long. That might make me sound like a piece of shit but I feel like I’m doing them a favor. If I could change myself I would, because life is theoretically a beautiful thing. There are moments where I wanted to live if at least for that moment but they’re short lived. \\n\\nThis is so long and a mess but if you’re still reading my nonsensical thoughts up to this sentence the point I’m trying to make is I’ll most likely kill myself within the next few years.

       " \"I’m 29/m and the last two years been a lesson to me, about friendship and being honest about my feelings, even though I’m still far from being where I want to be and probably never will be.\\n\\nIt all started about 2 years ago. I started to work in a call center, and I was still together with my long-term relationship (girl from another country, for 7 years). In this new job I met a really attractive girl called Janet who really was on the same level as me, I’m normally a real introvert person and it felt so good to be able to talk with someone and specially a girl in this way. We were laughing and talking during our breaks and later on been calling each other as the time went by.\\n\\nMeanwhile my long-term relationship was over, because of other reasons, she moved from another country to be with me but realized she isn’t happy here. It was and is no big deal for me, we are still friends and everything about it is fine.\\n\\nSo a period of partying, festivals and enjoying single life started for me after 7 years of being in a relationship, left some things to catch up. I never thought once about trying it with that Janet from work, we were always talking about what she was looking for in a relationship and what I am looking for, in the beginning she never sent me any signals. And over nearly a whole year it went on like this.\\n\\nBut after a few months something happened which made the whole story difficult. I met another girl called Nicole at our Christmas party (Janet didn’t go as she was ill), same department … we started to date, but one bad date followed the next, after like 10 months we got together (in between a long break) but I never felt this connection with her like I did with Janet. I always struggled with the situation because I knew she isn’t the one. But the time went on and we got along.\\n\\nI still met with Janet in our breaks and we went on calling each other and texting, but always in a friendzone way, but talking about very intimate stuff too. We were always talking about the relationship with Nicole in a funny way that she isn’t the one for me and when will I finally break up with her, but I just slowly I realized that Janet was serious about it.\\n\\nAfter another few months I finally made the decision to tell Nicole the truth that I don’t love honestly and want to break up. It was the worst feeling to break someone’s heart like this. It took me weeks to get used to it.One weekend I met with Janet and we had a really nice day together sightseeing a castle and talking and laughing the whole day.But at work things with Nicole became difficult, I saw her nearly every day at work and one day after about three weeks she confronted me and was crying in front of me asking me back. I became weak and after a while we got back together.\\n\\nThe thing is that I told Janet about the breakup and it made her happy, but back then I had no clue that she had more feelings for me…. When I told her about getting back with Nicole it broke her heart…\\n\\nThis went on for another few months, things changed, me and Janet didn’t talk anymore, and this fact made me really unhappy. Until things with Nicole went weird, she was always jealous about me talking to colleagues at work or when she found out that I was talking/texting with Janet in the past. I told her the thing with Janet is nothing and she forgave me.\\n\\nBut the next breakup with Nicole was just a matter of time, after the next Christmas party, when I was talking to all kinds of colleagues, she confronted me in front of everyone and I left. This was the moment I thought enough is enough. I told Nicole I break up now definitely and start a clean sheet and did he decision that I need to make things work with Janet again.\\n\\nI was afraid to talk to Janet, so I wrote a long text message, the longest I ever did. Basically, that I know now what I want, that I should have never risked our friendship and I feel like I’m just as bad as any other man and I will never forgive myself about what I did but I need to talk with her.Well, she replied with a voicemail which today still hurts me to think about, she told me that I will always be this way, that I hurt her a lot and she doesn’t want to give it another try with me.\\n\\nI replied that I’m really sad about it and that I had the best time with her …\\n\\nBack then I didn’t want to seem like an idiot and didn’t text her again.\\n\\nThis happened in December. Nearly 4 months later, I’m back together with Nicole. I can’t stop thinking about what a mistake I did with Janet and that I will never find a friend like her again and probably I would have had the best relationship with her. Nearly every day I think about breaking up with Nicole as it doesn’t feel right. And I know it’s not fair that I’m not honest to her about my feelings. Most of the days I have fun with Nicole as well, but it hurts me that I can’t love her the way I should and that I can’t stop thinking about Janet, even though she probably moved on already and doesn’t waste a thought on me.\\n\\nI don't know what to do to get over it, I just with everything would be the other way ...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSideinfo:\\n\\nJanet doesn’t work at that workplace anymore since last year October, so I don’t see her anymore and know what she is up to … every day I think about texting her and hoping that it could be all the way it was before but I can’t ignore the fact that she told me that it’s over between us.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate 12th April\\n\\nWell things took a fast turn in my story here - 3 days ago Nicole went through my stuff and found this post. From one moment to the other everything changed, shouting and crying started, I froze and couldn't explain properly what was going on, just that it's the truth. Not long after she left my place and since then I didn't hear anything of her anymore.\\n\\nIt's different than the times before as now I know that there is no way back anymore, what I did to her was horrible and god probably she won't be able to trust any man anymore. The last weeks we've been together 24/7 because of social distancing and working from home. We got along well actually and now that we broke up I feel like it's been all a big mistake, that I miss being together and having our days the way they were. I know she really tried her best in the last months and she was talking about all the things we should be doing and planning our future.\\n\\nI wish there would be an easy way to be happy again, I guess it will take a really long time. Now I just feel a big pain in my chest constantly and can't sleep properly since then.\",\n",

       " 'I\\'m 18, stuck in quarantine, and I\\'ve lost the only friends I\\'ve had over the past year. The thing is, I don\\'t even know why. We were a trio of friends that basically talked/texted/hung out every day and we knew that nothing really would tear us apart.. we argued here and there but we never threatened to leave each other. Recently, about a week before the virus hit and closed school and basically everything down, I noticed that the two friends (we\\'ll call them Emma and Sarah) were hanging out and talking to each other more than with me. I brushed it off, simply because I\\'m not very confident with myself and my emotions and I tend to think I\\'m overly sensitive sometimes so I didn\\'t really say anything. Emma and Sarah like a band that I don\\'t and because of that they would talk a lot to each other about it, I didn\\'t really think it was that much of a big deal.\\n\\n2 weeks into quarantine and things have gotten way worse. They don\\'t text our group chat anymore, they text each other instead. I know this because Emma posts some of their texts on twitter of which I follow and they know I see. Additionally, they have both been facetiming each other all night talking to each other while I\\'m awake and liking their tweets as they talk to one another without me. I thought they were doing this at first to talk about the band they like without bothering me, but then I realized they were adding other friends into the FaceTime that don\\'t like the band either. I know it sounds silly that I\\'ve been trying to make excuses for them but at the time it feels better that way because I can hold onto the two people who kept me going when I deemed myself majorly depressed and at times mildly suicidal.\\n\\nLast night my friend Emma posted on twitter that she missed Sarah (funny because they talk to each other every night for hours) and again is it wrong of me to think this is to antagonize me or am I just sensitive? So I commented, pretty innocently and no way ill-intended that I missed her too. No response. Ignored for 24 hours and they still proceeded to FaceTime each other all night without me.\\n\\nAt this point I feel like I\\'ve pretty much hit rock bottom. I\\'ve lost basically the only friends I\\'ve ever had and I still don\\'t know why. Feeling this way has triggered my depression even worse than its been and my eating disorder struggles which I\\'ve been trying to recover from for the past 3 months. I\\'ve talked to my therapist about it but she\\'s never offered me any sort of mind-blowing advise other than \"maybe they\\'re distancing themselves from you now that you\\'re leaving for college\" like it\\'s my fucking fault I lost my friends.  I\\'ve stopped taking my anti-depressants and I honestly have no motivation for anything other than I got accepted into university. I don\\'t know if anyone can offer any advise but I\\'m extremely clueless as to what to do as I\\'m so scared of confrontation and I\\'m unconfident in my own actions and thoughts. I\\'m scared as I\\'m feeling myself starting to spiral or if I don\\'t spiral I\\'ll suffer within my own angst and frustration.',\n",
       " \"The reason I never fit in is because when I am autistic and I was one of those kids who tried to make new friends and get to know people but it never worked out for be because I have parents who control me all the time. Certian bed times, certian times when I had to be home, certain games I can play. All these limitations my parents put on me as a kid drove my friends away from me to the point they didnt want to hang out with me anymore. My parents all the time say were helping you but they arent if they are limiting me to what I can do. Since I never could hold a friendship because of my strict parent rules I had to resort to something else. That something else became videogames. Ive been a gamer my whole life because I could never fit in socially with life because of my limitations. Now days as A young adult I still suffer from the same rules as I had as a kid. Im nearly fed up with my parents controling me my whole life. I don't know what to do. I worry I will never be accepted into society at all. Idk what I can do. Ive tried everything, nothing worked for me.\",\n",

I’m married with a newborn and I thought my life was looking better especially after the shit we went through together. We met in high school and I fell in love with her almost immediately. she’s smart, beautiful and funny as all hell but we didn’t get together until I was in the military and I was incredibly fucked up then. I had a drinking problem every day started with a cigarette and a combination of fireball and coffee that I called the breakfast of champions, I wasn’t happy about anything then and the only thing I knew made me 100% happy was video games and her but I didn’t think it would last at the time because good shit always ends in pain for me so in preparation for the inevitable end I cheated on her. I don’t feel good about it and frankly I hate myself even more for it because now my wife three years later still threatens to leave me and take our son. I’m now at such a low that I feel like drinking and flushing all these hard feelings away but I know I can’t because I don’t want to lose my son, I think I am gonna lose them anyway because she’s only talks about leaving with him and starting a new life far from me. It’s also my fault because I can’t control my rage anymore I got physical after blacking out due to rage and ever since she doesn’t trust me with our son. I’m on the edge again and now I’m stuck here with her and she hasn’t made it easy, it’s only been a day and we already are arguing with eachother. I just want our relationship to work again I don’t know what to do and I’m certain I’m gonna die alone at this rate. She was my world and now her and my son are my universe but I’m Just a black hole destroying everything and there’s nothing I can do to help myself anymore. My father offered to move her away from me if I get bad again and I tell her to leave me here with my son but she won’t leave without him and I don’t want that. If she leaves with him I think I might become suicidal again. I can’t lose everything. I can’t lose him. I can’t lose her. I’m stuck at home with my demons and family, tension and tempers are running high. Is this really the end of everything for me? If it is I get it, it was my fault but I’m standing on the edge again and her running from me might just be the gust of wind that pushes me over. I’m less afraid of what I’ll do to myself and more afraid of the loneliness. Idk I just needed to vent to people who don’t know me. Maybe I’ll come back and give a more in depth story on what happened it might prove to be good for me but maybe I won’t it all depends.',\n",
       " \"It's hard to put into words how I feel. That's mainly because it's a complicated situation. All I know for sure is that my mind doesn't work right. It can't even tell whether or not it wants to go on and live, or just shut off and die, all quiet like. Maybe it wants to scream and bleed until it unmakes something critical and falls apart. It already feels like the unraveling noose in my drawer. Hell, last night I fluctuated between crying, laughing, crying and laughing, screaming, gagging, spitting and drooling, and pummeling my head. It hurts though. My meds aren't helping. My therapy is honestly laughable. I know I need to think more positively; that's why I'm IN therapy. I can't tell whether or not it's the unrequited love that broke me, if it's the isolation, the lack of purpose or achievement, or what, but I'm broken. Some part of me died long ago, the part that could be happy. Now, all that's left are the festering remains of his corpse; the physical remains decaying in the playground, waiting to scare kids into a life of PTSD and sleepless nights. My emotions are the worst. I can't trust myself; I'm a man with ulterior motives, hidden to the world, yes, but also to himself. That's a fundamental truth. I feel wrong in everything I do, isolated and wrong. Evil is one way to describe it, but broken is better. I can't trust myself on just about anything. All I know is that I love someone, but the situation means that won't work. And maybe for the better. Myself cannot and will not be made happy by Myself, so how could I even dream of making her happy? I can't. I won't. I need to be a little braver, just need a little ounce, a speck, of bravery, and I can make her situation so much easier. I can remove what makes the situation complicated for her. I can remove myself; I've already served my purpose to her. I've given her a book, I've given her a place to stay when her situation gets dire. That's all she needs from me, and hopefully all she wants. I still have her hairpin though; she left it here when she crashed at my place. It's long, thin, and black. I could make a joke there, but I won't. Anyways, if I do end up mustering the courage and killing myself, I want that returned to her. Maybe my family or some investigative authority will find my post and read it, and give it back to her. That's all I can hope for.\\n\\nAnyways, I'm gonna quit my tirade now. If someone does find this, or if she reads it herself, make sure she knows I hope she enjoys the book I gave her. It's a good read. A bit long winded, but it's a whole lotta fun. If you wanna read it, it's called Blood Meridian. It's about a teenage boy named The Kid who joins a band of scalp hunters in the Texas-Mexico territory. They progressively descend into degeneracy and violence, and are led by a violent man named Glanton and the enigmatic, shadowy figure only known as The Judge. Check it out if you like westerns, or like a really violent, gruesome read.\",\n",

My boyfriend is great but I\\'ve lost interest, not even sure I love him.   I think I do but then again I catch myself wishing he didn\\'t \"live with me\" which makes things difficult because he is best friends with my best friend.  I\\'m in a stump, rarely ever shower, which is not normal for me since I use to shower everyday.  Showering just seems to take to much energy and I have little to none everyday.  I get to obsessed with new fantasy style shows to the point I\\'m awake for over 24 hours binging them on the weekends. and depending how the characters act/feel I tend to get it confused with my own emotions and don\\'t even understand how I should feel/act which makes my depression worse/confusing.    I get irritated easily because I can tell my bf gets mad/annoyed when I stay up on the weekends.   But IM A FUCKING ADULT. If I want to stay up I shouldnt be getting any bullshit about it.   He only works the weekends so I have to deal with him and my 4 year old daughter 24 hours for 4 days out of the week.  I love my daughter but I can\\'t keep up with her engery and it makes me feel like I\\'m terrible and useless as a mother. I rarely clean my house, but when I do it\\'s usually me doing it on the weekends if I get up the energy.   My boyfriend doesn\\'t help but gets pissed when things get too dirty.    Part of me wants to tell him to fuck off if he isn\\'t going to help and if he can\\'t stand how my house is. it\\'s my house and I don\\'t care if you don\\'t like it you ain\\'t doing shit to help out till it\\'s past way dirty (once in a while) and don\\'t even help pay my bills so don\\'t act like you own the place.

He is a good guy but he has a tendency to be to blunt, and he doesn\\'t clean because I don\\'t do it either (feels like an excuse which he berattes be about making excuses all the time).  I had hobbies that I was starting out to make money since I\\'m unemployed, I absolutely love my hobbies but lately the energy it takes to do them seems to much yet again. I wish I could just disappear or run away (if I had the money I would leave with my daughter and not tell anyone in a heartbeat)   I\\'m not suicidal only because I have to live for my daughter,  her bio dad is trash and she would be raised as a spoiled rotten rude child just like her dad and her aunt\\'s if something happened to me (her paternal grandparents would end up raising her because her dad\\'s to childish)  also because death seems like to much energy as well and yet again I don\\'t have the energy to Try.    I don\\'t understand how I\\'m able to even do anything when life and death both seem like a waste of energy.    I\\'m so tired all I want to do is lay in bed and sleep.    But I can\\'t.  And that drains more energy out of me.   I fight the lack of energy as much as I can but there are days when I notice I\\'m doing the bare minimum for my daughter.

My parents are aware of all of this but only keep pushing the same two answers for it: Exercise more and Therapy. I’ve tried both numerous times and it hasn’t helped at all. But back to the grades aspect of this, my parents expect the highest of me and don’t normally expect me to have grades. Whenever I do get a bad grade though they just blame video games or using my phone to much amount other reasons. They then take away my phone privileges or whatever it is and that causes me to be more depressed.

Normally I'm locked inside a shell of my own making, so this is one of the few opportunities for me to talk. I don't get to talk the rest of the time. There is no one to listen, y'know?\\n\\nToday, and I suppose for the longest time I have felt alone. This is no surprise for visitors to this subreddit. I suppose it is no surprise to most people, really. Everyone is lonely at some point in their lives. I don't want to claim I am different, because I'm not. I am not unique. However, I do feel alone and I have felt alone, and I have mostly always felt alone. I feel alone because I feel I don't think like other folks. That is an isolating notion in itself, without even factoring in social alienation and all the shitty things that happen to us as human beings, throughout our lives.\\n\\nI have had things happened to me that have made me question my self worth. School is school, right? Even now, though, it still impacts me. I am 31 now. School and my relationships there still damage me today. That sucks.\\n\\nThese days, I am in a foreign land and far from home. I yearn for the day that I can go back home. I'm kind of stuck here, for now, in a loveless marriage with someone that doesn't know what she wants or really cares for me in any meaningful way. I suppose meaning is derived from mostly anything, so there is probably meaning, but I guess I mean that there is no romantic meaning in how she perceives me.\\n\\nI just exist, and she exists, and we live. Just another warm body to see in the coming darkness. Just another meat sack to hold onto while we all drift apart. Such is life, right? Well, no, because I know better. That is the problem. I can't kill myself and I can't self destruct slowly because I know better. So, if anything, I just feel anger and impatience. It sucks to not be wanted, or to be mistaken for someone else, or to be collateral damage for someones whirlwind of self-discovery, but such is life, right?\\n\\nI guess I'm tired of the game. I'm a little tired of myself. I'm 31. 31. That's pretty old. I have no career and I have no notable achievements. I'm just another person in the crowd, like everyone else. That's okay, of course, but I know I have a lot to offer. I'm rich in character and spirit, and I feel like that should count for something. I'm not religious, so I don't really see the worth, I guess, but still. Something, right? I should be something, right?\\n\\nRight now I'm drunk. I haven't been drunk in 4 months. Last time I was drunk, I felt much the same. I sort of get in this zone of inebriation where I just want to go. I just want to go. I just want to walk and become a nomad. That has been my fantasy for the longest time. I'm not sure how long I will torture myself with it, but it seems to be perpetual. If there is more than this, then this  has some sort of spiritual link for me. I think my grandparents have to die before I can roam like I want to. They are old, and old fashioned. I don't want to disappoint them. I want them to be happy in their last moments, y'know? I don't want them to worry about me. I'll be okay, for better or worse. I'm okay with my path. I just want them to be cool.\\n\\nToday I just play games. I quit progressing on my freelance art. I pass each moment in rage or emptiness. That's okay, of course, but I just want it to end. I want to go home. I miss my home. I wish I never came here. I wish things didn't turn out this way and I wish I didn't trust as deeply as I did.\\n\\nBut, such is my path. Such is my choice. Such is my disposition. This is what I chose to walk. This is what I am. I give you all the benefit of the doubt and every time you disappoint me. The few people I keep dear, you are all far away and I wish you were not. It seems this is just the path I walk. My purgatory or my hell. I'm not sure which. I guess purgatory and my heaven will be the nothing at the end of it all. For now, I just keep on keeping on. I want to leave an archive of artwork, eventually, but it will be back home, on my island. My small island, from whence I came, where things make sense to me. I miss it and I miss the rains.\\n\\nI'm depressed, and I'm sad, and I'm alone. I don't know how to help myself, but I never did. I just drink. This is one of my few outbursts. Hello world.

The rules, regulations and restrictions along with the endless possibilities... The thing I have to accept but struggle to the most to accept is how we are all going to eventually waste away and die, if not sooner, maybe perish in some twist of fate or tragic accident. To say the least it troubles me. Deeply. On a level that would seem impossible to most. \\n\\nOf course it’s not always on my mind, it lurks in the shadows of it and reveals itself. The fear, the inevitability of it all gnawing at my thoughts until there’s nothing left but that. Terror. In its purest and most human form;. It just loves to pray on me in the night time it creeps into the covers and insomnia settles in to rest. \\n\\nThe other thing I struggle to believe is how it seems that everyone is just okay with this?! How. Do they realise that everyone they’ve ever met will be dead this time next century or so! That everything will turn to nothing? It feels that I am screaming into an empty void with no echo. No one to hear me or catch me when I fall into the depth of insanity and drown in madness. Maybe I’m the selfish one. The one who refuses to acknowledge that one day they will be no more. This fate is one that everyone pushes to the back of their mind and simply don’t think about because of the unpleasant nature of this thought. \\n\\nI heard this quote once it’s unsettling yet beautiful: “ Life and death have been in love, longer than words can describe. Life sends gifts to death and death keeps them forever.” I must confess there is such beauty in life, it’s wonderful. Experiences that build memories, tears, laughter, love, tragedy.. it’s all the same. How we are born from the stars and the earth and how we will become the earth. NO! I think to myself I can’t accept it I won’t! But then again..what difference does it make wether I accept it or not the outcome doesn’t change only the fear and frustration increase. The only way to be happy “expect nothing and accept everything” and how we must be happy in life and enjoy what we have. But, what is happiness? Emotions? Chemicals. People tell me to not worry about the things we cannot change. THAT IS WHY I AM WORRIED. I don’t really worry about the things I can chance because of the solid fact that I can change them. \\n\\nThe pointlessness is exhausting for me not liberating as some see it.. I wish I could chance my view, my perception of it all but I can’t. At least not as of yet I pray. I don’t believe in god.

Starting at christmas, i started talking to someone but after a month of getting closer, then them cancelling our meet ups i hated how i started feeling irritated and annoyed by small things and i hated myself for it. so i told them i needed to take time to get into a better place mentally. A while later (a month give or take) i tried to start things again with them, but they had already started things up with someone else.\\n\\nBut i want crushed, someone i met in a support setting messaged me out of the blue just before i was given that news. They were asking how i was coping. It cushioned a blow. After a week this person and i were getting close (i realised this was not a good idea in any way to begin with). Then one low night they messaged something and i read it in a certain tone that made me feel even lower. I started drinking, and drinking more and eventually i had drank half a bottle of rum straight. So in my vulnerable, defensive, 'self preserving' state i lashed out at them. Accusing them of horrible things that they had given me no reason to even suspect them of. \\n\\nWhat i was worried about happening with the first person, the huge blow out of irrational, hurtful feelings, just happened and on someone who in no way came even close to deserving it. The next day i absolutely hated myself and apologised as soon as i woke up. But i got no answer. Not for 2 days. In that time i tried to get their best friend to make sure they were ok, but even they got no answer. When they finally messaged back they just let it go, told me we were fine. But i couldnt accept that, i didnt want to be someone who could attack someone like that. So again i told them i wanted to take time to get better. \\n\\nOver the past week ive been hyping myself up to message them, to say i cant truely apologise and try to show them how much i didnt think the things i said were true, just drunken ramblings. And then today. I look at their ig and i see that theyre in a relationship.\\n\\nI felt sick to my stomach. I felt so... sad doesnt even express it.

From sixth grade to my senior year of high school I was a cutter, suicidal and depressed. I was exposed to many issues at a young age, hung out with the wrong crowd but I don’t regret it because it shaped me. Oddly, I think if I would’ve had a normal childhood, I wouldn’t have been as open minded as I am now. I started off cutting in sixth grade, which was a horrible thing to do at only 12 years old and I have scars on my arm that will last me my entire life, but I look at them as progress I have made. Things got worse through middle school, suicidal thoughts would linger all the time and my first interaction with alcohol and drugs began. I began feeling horrible about myself because of my appearance, bullies and home life. I began not feeling anything, crying all the time and planning ways to end my life. It was a slippery slope, but thankfully I did not fall too deep. I held on through high school to the cutting, though it became a nonissue from freshmen-sophomore year. \\n\\nI would say, going to such a small catholic school, I did not have the traditional high school experience in the way that I didn’t go to parties, we didn’t have the giant cafeteria with a football field right outside, it was pretty small, everyone knew each other. I kept to myself but made many friends and it was good for the first two years. I didn’t even think about cutting, I didn’t think about harming myself in any ways. In fact, right into starting my freshman year of high school I threw out all the blades and left myself with no manner of hurting myself. I was committed to the cause. Then junior year, I went through one of the most traumatizing years. I had fallen for a guy, my GPA plummeted and life was just bad. I felt so sad and empty. I would eat with my family for dinner and I literally couldn’t eat. For the first time, I had no appetite, I couldn’t bring myself to do that. It was such a dark time. I would go out to eat with my cousin and just throw up in the bathroom afterwards. I would take fake showers and throw up my food. It was such a bad time.  I didn’t think I would make it out of that. I couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel, I started planning my death. It was scary, I look back now and I can’t believe I made it out of that. It felt like time was frozen, I would sleep all the time, I would just look out my window. \\n\\nNow, I'm a freshman in college and am planning on being a doctor, to help people. I didn’t think I would make it to college. I regret spending so much of my youth being sad, letting myself not have a normal childhood. It’s bittersweet and I envy those that grew up in the perfect environment and don’t know that pain. I don’t wish that pain upon anyone though. Anyways, I’m not saying I don’t get the urge to self harm, because I do but very very rarely and I don’t have a constant sadness over me anymore. I’ve escaped and consider myself to finally be a “normal” person. It took years, it took self love, self care and a harsh reality that life is really so short that hating yourself is not worth it. \\n\\nThis will pass, it’s hard as hell but this will pass.

I began speaking out about my depression in 5th grade, but my doctors didn't take it seriously enough. And that led to my depression developing into psychosis and manic episodes. I suffer from visual and auditory hallucinations because it got so severe. I made my second attempt at suicide in 5th grade, when I tried drowning myself. Because of that, I have a slight fear of water now. 6th and 7th grade weren't as bad, middle school was actually great for me. But in 8th grade, shit happened. All of a sudden, my grades were dropping and I stopped taking care of myself. At one point, a teacher even reported a concern that I wasn't being taken care of at home because my hair was so messy. I was going through severe harassment, and there was one week where I cried every day on the bus, and that friday I was planning on jumping into the lake near my house with a weight tied to me. But I didn't. That was what got me to report it. Honestly, my history teacher is the only reason I'm still here. Because he actually cared. This year I started high school. First semester hit me like a train. My math teacher bullied me. And I hit the point to where I tried to hang myself in early January. The next few weeks were rough but I got better. I decided that life isn't worth it if I'm just surviving, I wanted to actually start living. I began taking care of myself. I began dieting, and I got in shape. I'm feeling great about myself. I'm at the highest point I've ever been in life, and I promise you it WILL get better. You just need to give it time. \\n\\nI'm four months free of a suicide attempt, five years clean of self harm, and I'm currently working on my anorexia recovery. I promise you can do it. Life really is worth it\",\n",

It really hurts when your dad insults you of all possible names. In addition I've always had a pretty low self-confidence and a lot of anxiety. After the argument I took 3 grams of medicine and drank a lot of alcohol because I read on the internet that it could kill you. I was feeling horrible and no one was coming to check if I was OK. I then took a bath to try and fall asleep in it as the pills and alcohol were really making me tired. I couldn't fall asleep because one part of me was saying that I should stay alive, but the other part was saying do it. I've always had a bit of anger management issues and so has my dad. I've never had a good relationship with my dad, I've always felt like he was only bringing negativity in my life. He never taught me anything and I can really tell he doesn't like me. He hates me and I hate him and that's really it. I don't know what to do and who to talk to as my whole family is on his side because they're afraid of him. I'm 16. Please help.\",\n",

       " '\\n\\n    \\tMy name is Nick. I am 15 years old and live in Minnesota. I currently attend park center senior high school... \\n    I\\'m here to tell my story and hopefully get some insight into my life and hear your opinions. \\n    \\tLast year I confessed to my parents that I think I have anxiety. I realized this while doing some research on how I feel living life over the 2018 summer. even then I wasn\\'t sure but I figured she should know because it would start affecting,y daily life. I would always have a high heart rate even know I\\'m a runner.\\n    \\tWhen I went in for my doctor\\'s appointment I took that GAD (general anxiety disorder) she later came back and basically said I have severe anxiety with a mild depressive episode. She started me on 20mg of Fluoxetine, the normal starting dose for kids. So after a while, I noticed that these meds were effecting me differently, my friends were asking if I was okay because they say \"I seem different\". I didn\\'t feel different at the time but I thought about it for the next few days. I noticed I was ALWAYS tired. I was never motivated to do anything. I would be the guy to watch my friends do something really fun and be happy for them, but I would be in the corner.\\n    \\tSo I started taking double my dose after I researched if my body could handle it. (max dose of fluoxetine is 80mg). so I was taking 40mg of fluoxetine per day) now the doc told me it might cause some tiredness so I always took it at night. after a little while of 40mg, I was still fucked up. I was getting more and more depressed and less and less anxiety. I was getting suicidal and had my phase with self-harm. \\n    \\tSo recently (maybe a month or 2) ago I asked my mom to make a 2nd appointment for my mental health. after conversing with my doctor about how I feel and telling her I\\'ve been taking double the dose, she said that we were gonna keep my dose off fluoxetine with 40mg per day to control the anxiety, and introduce a small dose of Wellbutrin to help with the depression. now Wellbutrin was supposed to perk me up a little and not be tired, so I had high hopes.\\n    \\tAfter a little while on these new drugs (again, month or so) I notice that I am experiencing terrible anxiety when I\\'m at school and as soon as I get home, I\\'m fine for like an hour then I just get incredibly depressed. it\\'s been bad. \\n    \\tI\\'ve tried to keep my head up and not fall back down so I\\'ve researched \"safer\" ways to cause my body harm and still get the pain I need. things like snapping a rubber band on my wrist to the point where it is red and swells up, and also sticking ice on my wrist and leaving it there, this causes pain to the arm and can \"burn\". (yes, an ice burn is a thing). \\n    \\tI\\'ve just been really pissed with the school system lately too because they really teach us the least important shit that we will never use. like yeah, i get they are teaching us to learn but teach us with the important stuff. like I\\'m mature enough, I can learn about taxes and mortgages and stuff. I need that extra challenge to keep me busy, but with my anxiety, my grades do not represent my smarts, so I stay in lower-level classes bored and depressed. I mean you might even be able to tell I\\'m smarter by the way I write this letter. I\\'m in 9th grade... cmon now.\\n    \\n    What should I do? I\\'m going to the doc in 2 weeks. what should I tell her?\\n    Thank you all, I really appreciate it.\\n    -Nick',\n",
       " \"I've never been medicated or been to an actual psychiatrist to be medically declared depressed, but there's always the thoughts. You all know how it is. \\n\\nI've attempted suicide once when I was 11 or 12..thought 9 1500mg Tylenol would do the trick 🙄 I felt like a prisoner in my own head and at home. I got tired of the pain and mental abuse and took them. Literally nothing happened. \\n\\nI confided in a friend at school about it because I always had thoughts of doing it again. The school counselor was called about it, so I was in her office. She had already called my parents about it. I talked to her about why I did it and what I thought would happen.\\n\\nWhen I got home that day, my mother sat on her bed crying her eyes out asking why I would try to do anything like that. I told her exactly what was going on with the mental abuse from home on top of school bullying and how years of that can get in your head and something just snaps in your head where you start to believe it. The daily hurt and not wanting or having the energy to leave your bed.  She promised to get me help and that things would change.\\n\\nNothing ever changed. Life at home steadily got worse and worse, but I never fully attempted to end my life again. The thought was always there, even on a good day. Always lurking around the corner to strike you down. \\n\\nI've been a frequent visitor in the school counselor's office since that day, I wasn't offered actual help, but I also didn't want my mother being in legal trouble for someone else's actions either. After a while, I just figured if I've survived this long without being medicated or having a therapist, why bother someone about it now? \\n\\nI deal with it by isolating myself when it gets too bad. I put myself on autopilot in a cycle. I force myself to eat, try to shower, I still sleep too long, I go to work, come home and do it all again. For months on end. When I finally get pulled from the fog of it all again, my friends question me, not understanding how I could lose track of time. Mistaking months for weeks. \\n\\nNow they're sort of used to it. I deal with it on my own. I do own a gun and an assortment of knives, but I don't plan on doing anything to bring myself harm, and they know that. Obviously they call/text from time to time to check on me\\n\\nA lot of the music put out by the rock genre has helped me over the years. Just knowing that others go through the same mental bullshit seems to help just a little, but they also tell a story of how they overcome the daily battle going on inside that gives us the inspiration to push through, even if it is on autopilot on most days.\\n\\nEnough of my sad sap backstory because I don't normally do all of this bs.. other people have had it way worse than me and I just felt the need to try to connect with some of you.\\n\\nLet's get to the point of the whole post:\\n\\nEveryone has a backstory that not everyone knows and everyone has been fighting the same battle in their heads day in and day out for years. Some have support and people they can reach out to for support but some of us don't or just don't want to feel like a burden to our families, which is why a lot of us are here. \\n\\nThe whole point of this post wasn't to bring anyone down, but to show that no one is alone in this scattered mess. We all have demons inside pulling at us, trying to break us, but we're still here! There's usually something or someone keeping us here and sane  for the most part.\\n\\nI've always turned to strangers on the internet to vent, talk, whatever when I felt like getting everything off my chest to try to ease my mind and thoughts, and ended up making some really good friends along the way. \\n\\nI just wanted to let you all know that if you EVER need someone to reach out to for support to keep going, I am here for you guys. I'll listen, I'll care, and I'll do everything in my power to help the best I can. \\n\\nI work nights during the week, so if you can't sleep, I'm your man. I've got SC and FB as well if you need me on there too. Whatever you need, I'm there. Trying to help others out of the pit has always helped me stay out of mine and it took a kick in the ass for me to remember that. \\n\\nI'm sorry for it being so long, but hold on, and keep your head held high. Live long and prosper!\",\n",

       " 'Life just seems unenjoyable and there isn’t really a point to it. \\n\\nI was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 15 in late 2018 and that just drained me of any happiness I had before.I was so angry/depressed when i got diagnosed and went through a whole denial phase but I had to finally come to a conclusion that im stuck with this forever and there’s nothing i can do/no cure and just have to stick with it :(. I keep having diabetes a secret pretty much from everyone and get ashamed/sad while talking about it. I just want to be normal and not have to worry about what i eat all the time, i hate having to go to the nurses at lunch to go put on my insulin because i always have to make excuses for me leaving to my so called “friends”( I’ll get to them in a second). All the mental stress that comes from battling this diseases, from having to plan out what I’m gonna eat everyday to checking my blood sugar and having what ever little numbers pop up change me mentally for the day. I just hate diabetes so much and really wish to be normal. \\n\\nI have little to no friends due to me being fucking socially awkward and really bad at making conversation, instead i just sit there hoping they’ll saying few to no words wishing they’d ignore/leave me alone when ever someone new tries to talk to me. My current friends right now are complete dick heads. They criticize/make fun of anyone and anything. From what my hair looks like to what sweater I’m wearing. I just can’t understand why they can’t accept me the way i am and just leave it be. I want a group of new friends so badly but i just can’t, my fucking social awkwardness just won’t fucking let me. My anxiety just raises to the roof when talking to someone new because i just freeze up not knowing what to say and worried about what they’ll think of me. \\n\\nI let everything get to my head and I’m worried about what other people think all the time. To the way they said something to how they look at me I’m just worried. I just want to have the freedom of not caring about what someone says but my mind just loves to overthink everything. Something so slight could happened 40 minutes ago and my mind would still be wondering about what they were thinking about me.  I hate it so much why can’t i just be like others and be straight forward normal and not care about what others think. \\n\\nMy mom is currently not a U.S. citizen and so she isn’t able to get healthcare and im afraid she might as well have diabetes. I’ve checked her blood a couple of times on my meter at times where she said she’s had really bad stomach pain and both times I checked it (different days) the meter read “HI” which means that your blood sugar is over 500. I’ve never had my sugar that high. There’s is nothing we can do to get her some help and the thought of losing my mom is crushing. It’s only me and my mom in my immediate family, we live with my uncle and aunt. My mom is really my best friend and really only one who really loves me in the this world unconditionally. \\n\\nI say my mom is really the only one who really loves me is because all my family treats me so different. My uncle and aunt are my second family meaning that my aunt is the daughter of my grandmas sister, and most of my main family is in another country so i never see them. At family gatherings and parties they treat me so differently than my other cousins and i hate it. I’ve known them all my life and just because im not immediate family you have to treat me so differently? Ever since i was a kid they would talk to me and treat me in a more serious and angry tone. My aunt and uncle are no different and living in this house with them sucks. I wish me and my mom had our own apartment and we are planning to get one once i graduate. \\n\\nSorry for writing all this and taking up some time out of your day to read it but i just had to get this off my chest.',\n",

My house was always a war, with screams every day (neighbor's never called the police, they are a bit far)... My father was always complaining about everything, saying we didn't deserve his effort and his sacrifice to build the house and everything we had. He used to humiliate me in front of other relatives, saying bad things about me... my father hit me the last time when I was 19 years old.

However, to my parents that's nothing, they were never proud of me!)\\n\\nNow I am looking for a job in the field that I studied so I can save up money and move out with my boyfriend. That is not an easy task. I have realised that I studied a field with shitty opportunities (few and bad paid jobs). Luckily I have an amazing boyfriend, who loves me and knows the terrible things I have suffered and hates my family.\\n\\nI was all of my life rejected by my classmates and I don't have friends. I always had temporary friends with who I lost touch. I think I was too needy for support and I was too vulnerable. I never told anyone, because I felt ashamed of suffering this violence. I didn't want other people to think I am a rubbish because my family treated me badly. I still am a emotionally weak and vulnerable.\\n\\nAfter all these years of violence (physical, emotional etc) I switched from the survivor mode to a depression.

I am questioning if I am a good or a bad person, because I want to do some king of revenge. My boyfriend tells me to never speak to my family again once I leave my house and I agree. I am worried that my boyfriend will leave me someday and I would be alone in this world. \\n\\nI have been medicated for depression for 3 months and I think I should see a therapist, because my boyfriend is getting overwhelmed for me always beeing sad and mentioning the same drama.

Im the youngest, so i \"get away with the most.\" My brother (Lets call *her  Sam)  (who\\'s technically now my sister, trans) used to choke me and beat me. My family just told me to stand up for myself and this continued for months until I actually did retalliate, to which I got in trouble. He left me alone after that, but fuck. I had to share a room with my brother* for 8 years, from 5 to 13, my other sister (And why not Katrina) and I shared a room previous because we got on better as children. He was awful the entire time we shared that space. Whenever he had friends over he would kick me out, or berate me in front of them, or just generally otherwise be a cunt. He\\'s always been quite fucking selfish. The morning I came out with cuts all over my arms and shaking, he was making himself some toast, simple fucking meal, I asked him if he coule put some on for me and he said \"do it yourself\". It\\'s irritating. She** recently had smashed a glass outside of my room, multiple shards of glass got into my carpet, to which she** told me to clean up. He was a disgusting pig who used to watch porn all the time, and sharing a bunk bed, meant he was always shaking it. Disgusting disgusting gross my god. (Leant him my computer couple yeara back and came back with transgender furry porn, shouldn\\'t have gone through the history) \\nI liked sharing a room with my sister. We used to watch barbie. It was nice. It was fun. But she hated me because I accidentally smashed her window too many times. Her room was an adjacent sunroom, so glass everywhere connected to the backyard. Being a kid, I couldn\\'t aim for shit and my father always being at work, with alcoholism and gambling issues and a bad back. (Will get into being socially outcast n friends n whatever else later, basically, had no one.) My mother was a paranoid \"keep your kids away from strangers\" type and so never let me leave the house, and whenver I did, I always had to be in contact with her. This is the same woman who said \"We knew --- was casually violent with ALethalDolphin.\" The man that Katrina then concieved a child months after having stood by him choking me infront of both her and my brother*. \\nI got my first job when I was 16. I had the oppurtunity to move out of the house and become my own man on more than one occasion, however my mother demanded I stay with her in order for her to be able to \"live\" without \"going under\" because she was already in so much debt from buying useless other shit. There was a time when we had $50 for groceries for the week, for 4, and she spent $25 of it on a giant plush toy. My mother and father have been split since I was 1. It has been hell on me and I get caught between the crossfire. I was unplanned. I don\\'t think I\\'ve grown up in a house with love at all really, just fake love. All a facade because everyone was too broken but too stupid to see it. I always get caught in this shit storm.

I’m 24 pushing 25 and 3 weeks ago I was 34 weeks pregnant, baby kicking all the time, (including at the doctors appointment I had that week) feeling miserable but so happy, and then 1 week after my seemingly normal check up about half way through my work shift I noticed I hadn’t felt my baby move recently which was really weird because usually he’d move so much I was in constant pain, and I texted my mom the moment I felt I knew something was wrong but I ruled it out as me being overly worried since I always worried about him, then when it didn’t change after work I left a voicemail with my doctor after getting some opinions. \\n\\nThey called me and told me to come in in the morning for a standard “non stress test”. After being up all night worrying I went in. When the nurse wouldn’t look me in the eye while checking his heartbeat, I knew what I was going to hear. She scheduled me for an ultrasound with my doctor for 3 Hours after she couldn’t find his heartbeat. Just to confirm. I remember the moment she told me. I couldn’t even look while they checked. After almost 8 months my son had no heartbeat.  I could see my boyfriend try to process the information fast enough to Both grieve and keep me from screaming in the same second . I wanted to scream but I couldn’t do anything but make broken noises. My worst fear prior was both getting pregnant before I’m ready or not being able to get pregnant at all (and he was an accident in the timing category) I never even considered losing a baby. \\n\\nThey made me and my boyfriend come in within 12 hours to induce labor. They had to do my IV 3 times (im scared of needles so that sucked)and my epidural twice because it wasn’t working enough the first time  (I was 6 cm before I let them give it to me) and after I went numb I cried through the whole delivery with my mom, boyfriend, sister and god knows how many nurses watching out of pure grief. My boyfriend held back tears the whole time as he coached me through pushing and told me he’ll always be with me and we’re going to get through this. I couldn’t feel anything physically but I knew the moment my son left my body and that’s the most heartbreaking moment I’ve ever felt in my life. \\n\\nI heard my boyfriend break down as he cut the cord and I couldn’t look. They let me hold me and it hurt so fucking much because I’d never seen a more beautiful baby and I knew he’d never open his eyes. He even still felt so warm. Like there’s no way he wasn’t alive. They were going to let me leave within 5 hours of delivery but in old town being myself to give him back because they said I could spend as much time with him as I want and if you’ve never been in this situation it might sound really morbid but I’m so glad I did it but I didn’t want to give him back til about 12 hours later. and what was even worse is he looked like me and everyone in the room saw it. I was prepared for him to look like his daddy but he had a lot of my features  and now I can’t even bare to look at myself because all I see is him. I just got the autopsy results back and there was nothing out of the ordinary and I don’t know if that hurts more or less. \\n\\nI feel like such a failure as a mom and a girlfriend because I was so ready (but also not) to be his mommy. Don’t get me wrong my boyfriend doesn’t blame me in anyway but I can’t imagine how looking at me must feel despite what he says because he sees our son too.

After I failed to get anything back aside from a few pairs of kid\\'s jeans, the interaction made me so flustered I flipped out in frustration in my office that night and broke one of my boss\\'s monitors as it fell onto the desk. I know it was bad and I have impulsive/anger issues, but I cannot describe how frustrated I was. It\\'s certainly not the first time someone gets past me by any means, every week I miss a thief by a hair, and they get away. I will always get upset when someone steals and gets away. That said, the anger that caused me to lose my temper stemmed from the situation and interaction with that specific person. The person was just screaming and cursing at me, in a patronizing way. She yelled \"Is it because im black?!\" multiple times before speeding off with the door still open. I get called racist/cussed at all the time there, but usually what happens is they react that way when I am successful. What made me mad was she knew was she was doing when she said that, and she got away with it. I was at the end of a 15 hour shift, and her yelling got under my skin, she thought I wouldn\\'t do anything. Usually I would have the police pull someone over if I can\\'t get them myself, but my boss doesn\\'t allow me if she\\'s not there and she was on vacation. I just felt helpless, I couldn\\'t do anything. I wasn\\'t about to open her doors and snatch the stuff. I should have stopped her before she left the doors, but the merchandise was in large plastic bags, it made me hesitate. I quickly realized she was stealing when she made a run for it, but she parked in the handicap area, so I was too late by the time I got out there. That said, I was on my final for previously going into the lot so if I got caught doing it again, it would be my own fault. But I didn\\'t think about it, I just acted in the moment. I never sprint/chase after people or intend to hurt anyone. I just wanted to at least try knowing there still might be a chance when there\\'s hundred of dollars at stake. And I am certainty not the only one who takes the risk of going into the lot. In fact, my boss has admitted to doing it and many other leaders have admitted to doing it on a few occasions. At the end of the day, I can only blame myself though because I was already warned and I ignored.\\n\\nI\\'ve felt this pit in my stomach all day. I feel so worthless and ashamed of myself. My boss was straight up disappointed and told my friend she thought the video of me getting mad was \"disturbing\". I\\'m not saying me lashing out was in any way okay. I deeply regret it, but it makes me feel like I can\\'t be angry.  It just hurts that the perception my boss has of me after 8 months of working and growing together, in the blink of an eye, she is disturbed and ashamed of me. Ashamed for going into the lot and disturbed by my lack of emotional control. It just hurts knowing I failed her... She never cared about getting anything back, but she cared for my security, and I took it for granted. The location I was at was very high in theft, but I transferred over there specifically for that reason. I felt I needed more experience if I wanted to move up. They moved me around a lot for their own reasons for the first several months, but ultimately when a spot opened, I was asked if I want to go to this location because they needed someone who was pretty good at stopping theft. I had the choice and I switched over because I thought if I caught more thieves, I could prove myself. And I did catch a ton of thieves. I could of just stayed at my previous location where nothing was happening, but I strove to grow. I worked so much harder than the majority of other loss prevention employees. There are those who play fantasy football, watch the game, call friends, text, go around talking to chicks all day, some that just consciously sit by as people stuff their bags. I\\'ve worked with so many complicit people who just don\\'t care, they get paid either way. I was fired because I took my job way too seriously. I took it personally... I know those are my faults, but it\\'s hard to not feel bad when I am **fired** over it. Maybe it\\'s just the stigma, but I just feel horrible about myself... Everything gone just like that.\\n\\nThis job honestly meant so much to me and I took it for granted. It was the only thing in my life that gave me spark anymore. The only other thing in life I enjoy is lifting weights, but that has been hindered by some injuries and a surgery I had a year ago. I haven\\'t had a relationship in over 3 years and it\\'s lead me to so much loneliness and self-hatred. College has been okay but it\\'s been hard to motivate myself as I am close to graduating. Even though my grades are great as of the last few years; a I had a rocky first couple of semesters when I started because of previous depressive issues I had back then, and my GPA is forever ruined. I have been insecure about getting into graduate school because of it and lately have considered just continuing my job.\\n\\n I felt like I finally belonged somewhere for once. Something I was finally good at and enjoyed. Somewhere where I finally felt appreciated. But I ruined it. I have struggled with self-harm and impulse issues for a majority of my life and I never addressed it properly. I lost control and I can\\'t take it back. And now I have no income to pay for my tuition/bills/food. I feel worthless and I am upset with myself. No one will remember me for my hard work or the thousands of dollars I saved, but rather for losing my temper and breaking company property like a child. I lost the respect of all my peers. I lost respect for myself.',\n",

And I guess for people to kinda understand why I feel this way I guess I’ll start by talking a bit about myself and what I’ve been through. \\n\\nI grew up in the south and I’ve always had an issue with myself from being self conscious and having low confidence in myself. It was bad to the point that being numb felt like normal after years of being depressed. I’ve been through sexual assaults as a kid and even physical abuse. After I got in middle school I started to practice being happy. And I got pretty good at it. But that all it was, just an act. I was never really happy. I never really had any friends and not for the lack of trying. I just felt like a burden on them and left them alone after a while. I started to think I wasn’t meant to be happy but maybe I should at least try and be like a kid. I eventually started highschool and thought it was a chance to change myself. So I decided to act more confident. But i wasn’t it didn’t help. I barely talked I had some connections with people but I wasn’t happy. I was content because I was not fitting in. I lied to myself and everyone making everyone think I was happy I was enjoying a relationship I was in. And after a while I even lied to them and said things I didn’t mean. Telling people that I’m happy that I loved them because it felt like something that would be said in this situation. I was never feeling anything. I was numb to everything. I cut myself because it was something to feel until even then I couldn’t feel pain. I was pretty much a zombie. Not feeling anything and going through the motions of life forcing a laugh or a smile pretending to enjoy my time with the people that called me a friend. Going through the actions of life not thinking I’m going to even make it out of highschool and I almost didn’t. My freshman year I had the chance to do drugs. A bunch of drugs. I’ve done heroin, coke, acid, inhalants, weed, smoking cigs, pain killers, I drank a lot. The biggest crutch was pain killers and I loved them. It got me out of my head by giving me the feeling of an escape from everything but I was never better and it made things worse. I eventually tried to kill myself with them thinking that was it. I’m finally free but no I wasn’t. I woke up in the hospital I tried to hang myself but my bed broke the first time. Then the fan broke. Then I even tried to drown myself but no matter how hard you try unless you are weighted down by more than you can lift then you will still try to breath. You will still fight to live subconsciously. I always tried to slit my wrist from wrist to elbow but I never could because I didn’t want my parents to see me sliced to pieces. And I eventually went to a mental facility for it. It didn’t do anything but help me understand how to act better. I saw a shrink and delved into the post became a pariah to my own family for telling the truth. My brother beat me to a pulp my step dad only got worse so I would get him to target me when he got drunk instead of going after my mom or sister. The final three years of highschool were just like the first except I was clean. No drugs no tobacco nothing. I acted better and people thought I was but I wasn’t. As soon as I turned around I would lose all expression. I wasn’t afraid of anything. And finally I met a girl that I started to date and based the entire relationship on nothing but a lie. That my feelings were real and that I was happy with her but I wasn’t I was miserable but I felt I had to keep up appearances. I’m not proud of it by any means especially since she was emotionally and mentally abusive to the point she made me drop my friends and entire family because she didn’t like them. And I did it because I thought that’s what people do when they are asked. I was miserable. More miserable than I was before. And then she got pregnant and I was trapped. She took the kid from me and I got back into school I went to school to be a mechanic and then moved to another state and started over with someone who I got along with I considered him a friend. He was an ass but a friend. He helped me experience new things. Things I didn’t want to be apart of but things. No not drugs but I was drinking more than a fish was to the point I was able to keep up with him within a month. But i moved to another state and got a job that I enjoyed the first time I actually woke up and was pleased to go to work. I wasn’t happy but it was still something. And then i somehow ended up getting a fwb and just went with it. I didn’t want relationship I didn’t want anything emotional because I’ve never been emotional. I don’t cry I don’t care about anything. And if I’m being honest I didn’t even want the fwb. I didn’t have any drive at all. Like to the point I couldn’t even get myself off or even hard most of the time. I ended up quitting because I got fucked in my hours and was without work for a month worked as a cashier and then got a second job at another place where I met her. I looked at her that first day and felt weird. I actually felt something. For the first time in what seemed like a life time. I looked forward to coming to work to work with her. To hear her talk to see her eyes light up and sparks when she would tell me things the was so passionate about. I loved it the first thing I enjoyed more than the pain killers that nearly killed me Years prior. She was way out of my league she was gorgeous and I didn’t want to lose her so I had to at least be her friend. So I became her friend she became my first real best friend. And I made the mistake of telling a coworker that I think I liked her and they tried to set me up with her and I found out she had a bf. I was devastated. I got drunk a few days later and drunk texted her how I felt and forgot about it all. Until the next day I thought I lost my phone and went to work to see if I left it there and ran into her and it all came flooding back and I apologized profusely I even quit drinking so much because I felt so bad. I mean she had a bf I couldn’t come between that so I tried to move on I tried to forget my feelings and ended up meeting up with my fwb that I hadn’t talked to in forever. Trying to get over her but it didn’t work I only felt like utter shit because I did that when I had actual feelings for her. For the girl that made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside when I walked into work and she would smile when she saw me when she hugged me for the first time I didn’t want to pull away but I couldn’t let her know I had feelings for her. I had to play like I didn’t love her and it killed me every time we would smoke some weed at work and one day we danced to her fav song and I never wanted that moment to end I loved it I loved her I couldn’t deny it anymore I knew what I felt. And we held eachother after the song ended. I bought that song a few days later and listens to it everywhere. For days and it’s still my fav to this day. I can’t ever get tired of it because that’s what I think of every time I hear it. Then one day I kissed her. She said something and slowly turned away she looked like she regretted telling me she wished that she wished I was the reason her lip was hurting. And when she turned I grabbed her arm and kissed her. I kissed her hard and what seemed like forever. The world went silent and my heart was bound to burst. And all I wanted to to keep going but she pulled away. We ended up together and I felt happy I felt while I felt like she was the one I knew she was the one for me I still believe it in my heart. She made me feel all these emotions I’ve never felt before and I even asked her what some of the things I was feeling were since she knew I have never been an emotional person. She opened me up so much I cried during a Disney movie. I didn’t even cry during lion king. I teared up thinking about her walking down The isle to me I cried because she did something so fuckin cute I didn’t know what to do. I wrot her poems and letters and notes that we left all over the house. Then she found out about my past and she started to resent me for it all all the things I mentioned and all the things I didn’t. And I tried to keep her happy I tried to keep things up she made me so happy even when I was in my head she would hold me and I would be alright. She resented me so bad that she would throw my past in my face and I wouldn’t say anything because I didn’t want to fight anymore but I still loved her and I fought tooth and nail to keep her here with me to tell and make things better and for a while I thought things were but they weren’t. I still love her with all I am but I can’t go on anymore. She’s gone and all I have are what she’s left in our house and these memories of all the things I’ve never done before with anyone but her and she doesn’t believe me when I say that it’s the first time I’ve done this or seen that or been here or tried this. But I love her and I tried to convince her. She hates me for what I’ve done and I love her just as much as always. And she’s gone. Forever. The one person I felt anything for that made me feel anything at all and I’m left ruined. And beaten and broken and I can’t do this anymore. She was my wife.

I could have the best drive of my life and shank it into the woods on the next hole.  If I was slicing the ball I would work to fix it, then overcorrecting and having a duck hook.  I eventually got down to a single digit handicap but never was able to break 80.  I fudged a lot of those scores too.\\n\\n**Lacrosse** God I wish I could\\'ve been good at this sport.  All the lacrosse players got girls with ease in high school/college.  I tried playing when I was 6 and hated it, I hated wearing a helmet and pads.  I refused to try again in middle school even though my parents begged me.\\n\\n**Basketball** I never played on a team at all so I think I have a pass here.  In college I actually enjoyed playing pickup and sometimes could hit a solid 3-pointer but again I was so inconsistent and looked stupid when I dribbled.  I also cannot fathom for the life of me how people set picks and stuff like that\\n\\n**Football** Again I never played on a team because I hated contact sports with pads.  But I could never learn how to throw a good spiral consistently.\\n\\n**Baseball** I don\\'t know why I ever played this sport.  I should\\'ve stuck with lacrosse.  I couldn\\'t throw far at all, I don\\'t know how others had such good arms.  I was also a really inconsistent pitcher.  I was so scared of going to bat and getting hit with a pitch too.\\n\\n**Swimming** I was too scared to go underwater until I was 7 years old.  I really hated the idea of getting in a pool and swimming laps.  I looked like a total spaz and couldn\\'t keep myself going straight.\\n\\n**Skiing -** I can get by on skis for sure, but I\\'ll be guy taking his sweet ass time down the black diamond.  Wish I had tried snowboarding but I probably would\\'ve sucked at that too\\n\\n**Hockey**  Yeah this was never going to happen.  You basically have to learn two sports at once.  Getting my ass to move on hockey skates wasn\\'t gonna happen\\n\\n**Ping Pong** Ok I\\'m pretty sick at ping pong actually\\n\\nOverall I was usually just a weak little pussy who couldn\\'t do anything.  I\\'m pathetic lol.  When you look at some of the most successful people, a lot of them were great athletes at one point or another (varsity captain in high school or even played in college).  Seems like there\\'s a trend where people like me who looked lost and hopeless on the sports field don\\'t make it in society.',\n",

       " 'Hello, I could really do with some help. For the first time in my life I genuinely want to just die. Having come to this point makes me feel extremely sad. I feel like I’ve been fighting for years for myself, by myself to constantly pick myself up when I feel down or when something goes wrong in my life. I’m sure people have had it much worse...but I always feel like life is just out to get me no matter what I do. \\nFrom my first memories of interacting with people (ie going to nursery) I have been picked on and made to feel worthless, disgusting and like something is so wrong with me. I remember trying to have friends and longing for someone to just decide ‘I like you, I’m going to be your friend’. I think I had one or two years of school where things were ‘normal’. In primary school it got so bad that a kid tried to drown me in the pool; she would call me ugly and disgusting everyday and would go out of her way to stop people from talking to me. I remember walking around the playground on my own trying not to cry. What was so wrong with me that justified me being treated this way? The few interactions I do remember were of a kid trying to be sexual with me and touch me...at such a young age?!\\nI’ve always been thrown to one side eventually. During high school I had one friend and we were inseparable for half a year, then one day she just never talked to me again and when I tried talking to her she would just pretend I didn’t exist or scream in my face. I had another friend for half a year..I say half a year but we acted as friends for a few years. She would tease me everyday about something, constantly told me I was stupid, made me believe things she told me just to laugh and call me stupid when she revealed it was just a lie. Sometimes she would even slap me, sending my glasses flying off my face just to laugh to watch me run to pick them up. Other than that I wasn’t ‘cool’ enough to have anyone interact with me or even pretend I existed. During the end of my school years I did eventually find a friend group and although it was a fight for attention, I feel like there were some genuinely nice people. I remember when I got a boyfriend and I started being invited to parties and finally felt that maybe I’d changed in all the ways I needed to after all these years to make people like me, or maybe think I was fun to be around. Then I discovered they only invited me because they wanted my boyfriend there. \\nMy relationship with my boyfriend was difficult as I was a highly anxious person and my boyfriend was dealing with depression and night terrors, which made me feel very low at times and I resorted to self harm quite a few times. I was in college at the time and found a friend which was extremely helpful despite being picked on by others as usual. During this time I made another friend with a boy. He invited me round his house one day, only to shut me in a room and attempt to rape me. Around this time I also started to get in fits of anger, but mostly began over eating and drinking until I would throw up. I was so obsessed with my boyfriend and til this day will say I’ve never been more in love. I had someone who was into all the ‘weird’ hobbies I was and spent nearly everyday with me....someone who understood me and saw me. Life felt somewhat good for once, what was next to go wrong? \\nMy mum unexpectedly died when I was 18. Having no friends and only my boyfriend and mum to emotionally pick me back up, now I fell hard onto my boyfriend. Until 2 weeks after her passing he broke up with me, saying he can’t deal with me anymore, and with little evidence of caring. It was at this point something clicked and I felt like I’d grown up and almost had this freeing feeling. He even begged me to come back and I was so sure the damage was done...I was already dating someone from work. He was a lot older than me. Fast forward through two years, living together, finding out he was in debt and taking out two loans so we could have enough money to live together, going through one of the scariest moments of my life- an abortion when my partner didn’t want me to, him being diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar, getting a dog, and dealing with fits of anger and tears from him everyday where I’d feel scared to go home or be in the car with him, and having to work non stop to pay for mine and his half of the bills, I decided enough was enough. I then immediately met someone else who seemed confident and made me feel safe. I had some of the best moments of my life with this person looking back. I’d never experienced the type of inclusiveness I felt from him and his friends..finally people who seemed excited I even entered a room! Who constantly told me I was pretty, funny...everything I could imagine! We got a place, only for him to not work, not clean the house...I believe he was depressed. He mentioned having ‘seasonal depression’. He wouldn’t move all day, not showering, and would throw plates and food wrappers to the floor for me to clean. He also said he was diagnosed with being a sociopath. I had extreme fits of anger during this period and was the closest Id ever been in my life to seeking help but didn’t bother. He played with my emotions for a while, even his friends were worried for my mental health because of how he treated me. I had my fourth ever anxiety attack during this period. He then got  rid of me, owed me lots of money which I wasn’t ‘worth’ his time paying back for...it was extremely hostile. I found out after he had cheated on me. I’m glad I found out after. I healed quicker than I thought, probably because I was genuinely better off without. I decided to concentrate on my life...until my (current) boyfriend sent me a message and we started chatting. I thought I could and would finally do life on my own, but he was so kind and I felt so happy, which I hadn’t felt in a long time. I remember him from high school although we never interacted on any level..he was one of the most popular people who would have never looked my way in a million years..it sounds so so silly and childish I know, but I was quite pleased with myself that he was interested in me! And it was going really well. I finally ditched my full time hours at my job of 5 years to peruse my dream of studying a uni course, and although I have my down days I have tried so hard to do this for my future! I got my driving license, which brought up my problems with anxiety but I overcame! I booked my dream holiday to Japan with the love of my life! I could see a future, my life plans are heading where I want if I just keep going!! \\nUntil 6 months ago. My boyfriend stopped giving me any form of attention...he would come over, stare at his phone...I would almost beg for his attention and he would physically push me away saying I’m ‘too much’. I tried talking to him multiple times, no matter how many times I would say ‘this is serious now’ he wasn’t changing. He would either deny it saying that I don’t give him attention either or I’m being dramatic. If you love someone why is it hard to give them attention? For weeks I would try to work out what was wrong...am I not funny enough? Not pretty enough? Not interesting? Am I annoying? We would have arguments and they would get really bad. Whenever I brought something up he didn’t see eye to he would call me boring. He said he can’t stand me shouting, and I said I couldn’t stand him calling me boring. Then a few months ago he told me I was right all along. He knew something was wrong with him to not give me attention, and he didn’t know why he let the arguments happen, didn’t know why he let me believe all those awful things about myself. When I tried to voice how hurt I was, all he could say was that it’s not all about me and that I don’t understand how horrible it is for him to not be able to show he cares. He said he was getting help and I will just have to wait it out. So I did that for a while...until I couldn’t take it anymore and told him things needs to change or I can’t be with him anymore. I cannot deal with this hurt. I said I wasn’t sure if we should break up or not and he desperately didn’t want it. And we haven’t been talking for 4 weeks. In a way I feel he owes it to me to make that effort, and that I need to stand up for myself and he needs to put the effort in for once. Then the other night he comes over drunk, gloats about how he (not we)...he hasn’t been talking to me. He then encourages me to drink and I do, then we end up sleeping together. The next morning he wakes up, says ‘that was fun’ and then cannot wait to leave without a further word or care. I don’t understand because I know my boyfriend. He wouldn’t cheat, wouldn’t purposely play with me, I believe he genuinely has or had feelings for me. So I don’t understand. And I don’t have the mental energy to try to understand anymore. The past few months I struggle to get out of bed, everyday I’m honestly scared to leave my house because without a doubt either I end up doing something so stupid and reckless that I’m left feeling so guilty and stupid and embarrassed (eg driving recklessly, making a huge mistake at work) or someone else is making me feel worthless (eg a customer is extremely rude to me, I get overloaded with work and can’t cope). These past few months I have felt worse than I did when I was younger somehow. I want to crawl in a ball in my bed and act as if I don’t exist...which I am actively doing always. All I had left was the love I felt for and from my boyfriend. To be honest if he just said he wasn’t feeling it then it would be easy. It’s the fact that yet again I’m being absolutely stepped over.\\nIn a way I feel like I’ve given the world so much of my energy and motivated myself to be kind and patient, and keep going even though I have been constantly used as a punching bag, that the world owes me something!! I have tried and tried and tried and nothing I do reaps me even the simplest reward of feeling somewhat content for a reasonable amount of time. \\nWhat family I have left (my sister and dad whom I live with) think I’m a waste of space. I know this because they moan at me everyday, sometimes I feel I could breathe and they’ll shout at me for being an inconvenience! If I try to talk to them they would shout at me to go away...I didn’t even see them cry at my mums funeral! Honestly right now I feel that the only fuel keeping me alive was my boyfriend like I said...happy relationship=positive attitude=actually getting out of bed and wanting to study or go to work! \\nAnother major issue I have is I have an absolute crushing feeling that my time is running out..I’m 23, I should be getting engaged soon and then married and then a house and want kids after 30 but I need those things before and to complete my uni course and get my perfect job but I can’t even get out of bed and my relationship is in shambles..it’s just too much! What is the point!? I feel scared and anxious and hurt and used and not good enough not pretty enough and I work to have enough money to just about do the things I want but all I want is for someone to love me and want me why can’t someone just anyone care about me and I have no friends but I don’t want friends because I hate people no matter how hard I try they use me  to make themselves happier and healthier whilst I’m left in the dirt wondering what I did wrong and the one thing I have left now (my boyfriend) is absolutely torturing me emotionally and I just can’t bare it anymore! My life was just not meant to be happy. There is no way one person can have so much bad luck in 23 years! Which means there is something wrong with me, and I don’t have the strength to deal with that anymore. Maybe it is my fault, that it has gone on too long and too deep for a fix. I feel like I’m terminally ill...there is nothing that can be done no matter how sad that news is, and I have been through 23 years of absolute pain, I should just end it now. I will not let this world hurt me anymore-you will not enjoy my pain any longer, I will find my own peace!! \\nI feel like nearly every person I have met has every day lead to betrayal or being told/being made to feel I’m just not good enough. After dealing with that over and over again for 23 years how can you fix that? I have been conditioned to not trust and always be on edge, waiting ready for the next thing to slap me hard in the face. I believed it makes me stronger, but it hasn’t. I’m at the bottom of a hole I convince myself is not very deep, but I can’t see any light anymore. I have nothing more to give and I don’t feel shame in that. I feel I have tried. Like I said it was just not meant to be. Writing these things down, I hope I am able to allow someone to read this without feeling stupid and silly, so perhaps I don’t kill myself just before my life was to improve. In order to do that also whilst writing this down, I realise I dissociate myself from these experiences I write about. If I was to honestly even properly think about the situation with my boyfriend at the moment I think I would go downstairs right now and swallow all the pills I could find. \\nI will stop my train of thought there as I don’t want to bore you anymore with this pathetic-ness, mr/mrs reader. My final thought is this: when I was 17 I told my boyfriend (at the time) that I have this absolute overpowering almost spiritual feeling that I would not make it to 30. I forgot about that until today. Isn’t that funny?\\n\\nWith all my love,\\nHopeless',\n",

Stayed in bed for at least a week didn't eat at all just kinda thought about her the whole time. Well we ran into each other at school started talking as friends figured out her and one of my best friends were dating. Just kinda died inside and froze up for a minute.

I was extremely unmotivated to the point taking a shower and changing the sheets on my bed were a struggle. \\n\\nAs of recently, we both moved on, but the suicidal tendencies continued. I haven't self harmed, but there were times where i was close to. I've been biting my nails as a coping mechanism. The closest I've got to hurting myself was when I pressed a knife against my leg and dragged it across lightly. Ever since the breakup, I been to the hospital twice or more because of a stomach virus and it evoked my fear of vomiting/choking but of food in general. I stopped eating regularly and started purposely starving myself. I couldnt have a full meal without having a small anxiety attack about it afterwards. After doing a bit of research, I realized I might have Avoidant/ Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (AFRID). My family noticed the change in the way I was eating, but instead of helping me, they liked to tease me. \\n\\nI've opened up to my history teacher about my issues which led me to have a mental breakdown in front of him twice. He told me i needed to talk to my parents about it, but I couldn't do it. I love my parents a lots, but I've closed my emotions off from them. I feel extremely uncomfortable talking to them about this but I feel okay talking to strangers about it. Maybe a part of the problem was that I was beat as a kid, but I'm not exactly sure.

I’m a 15 year old girl from urban Georgia attending a fairly prestigious high school.\\n\\nWARNING* if you are triggered by thoughts of suicide or self harm please don’t read this\\n\\nI wouldn’t say my life has been particularly tough...except the past few years. In the past few years I’ve had to leave my 9 year long friends and go to a different school, form new friendships, only for them to be broken again when I had to go to another new school because my parents believed it was best. In 7th grade(first year at school number 3) I found out that my mother had developed a drinking problem and had started abusing my father, who never hit her back even though all her abuse. It shook me to my core that someone I trusted so much could simply turn into a monster...I was and still am scared of her. I became withdrawn socially because run my mind “why should I trust more random people around me when they will either leave me behind or could become like my mother.” I fell into a depressive state. I would dig my nails into my wrist to stop myself from crying everyday. Every night I was up til midnight or later, listening to my mother yell at my father for thing he had never done, hearing her throw all sorts of shit against the walls, and finding dents in the morning. I lived in constant fear basically, but 8th grade was when I hit rock bottom. My mother abuse became more physical, she threw a large lamp at him, slapped him in the face with shaving cream when he was sleeping, threw and broke multiply glasses, and scratched whore into the side of two of our cars...one of which I’ll be driving. She had accused him of sleeping with a much MUCH younger co-worker (she was like 20 and he’s in his late forties) which she had no evidence nor reason to believe, because whenever I asked her why she thought that she just said “he is”. She also became a bit abusive towards me, yelling at me for minor things. I became a soulless empty husk all of 8th grade. I honestly don’t remember much since I was a walking mindless zombie. I considered suicide multiply times that year, even thinking about the most painless and quick way to do it. There was a night I was so close to doing it but didn’t have the guts to leave my old sister and father who I both loved so much, behind. I continued to dig my nail into my arm, I started punching my leg and or banging my head on a wall when I was in a bad state. I also started cutting up my arm with my nails, which were pretty long and once cut my leg up with an exacto knife...I hated everything about myself, I couldn’t look myself in the mirror with out sobbing, I had a 2-3 supportive friends at dance, but no one at school had any idea. I faked a quiet smile throughout the whole year. I stopped going to lunch and at a snack in the bathroom. I became unable to handle being in crowds or loud noises (because of my moms yelling I’ve also developed a fear of yelling and have to calm myself down). \\n\\nBeginning 9th grade I slowly started to get better, I began talking to and reaching out to a bit more people at school, which was pretty difficult and took many tries to even speak to others. My sister realized what was going on and had been helping me, I got a bit closer with my sister close friends too. I still struggled at feeling useless and I hated watching myself dance even though I’m at a pre professional level, I forgot to mention earlier but I dance 5-6 days a week 9am-5pm on Saturdays and am a soloist in my student company, but i have become a bit more comfortable with my looks. I’ve remember the first time I genuinely laughed since 7th grade. I wasn’t close friends with anyone at school but I felt more comfortable commenting on people’s posts and texting them to ask questions. I stopped letting people take advantage of me ( people would ask for me to buy them food and then be like “omg you are so my best friend thank you so much!!” ). I’m still healing and have many scars. My father snapped and told me mother he wants a divorce, he attitude changed completely once she realized he was serious, because she knew I would want to go with him and she cleaned up her act trying to act all nice and buy me things so I would break him more than she ever could but I didn’t and simply pushed back at her. I’m no longer scared of my mother, she’s raise me to be intelligent which sucks for her cause I now can fight back with legitimate facts and reason, I can now stand up for myself and am not afraid to yell at her at the top of my lungs. I would say I’m okay. But I’m not.\\n\\nMy sister is leaving for collage and I’m scared since she has been my main support leg. My dance studio is falling apart and all three of my other support legs, my best friends in the world. Are ll moving away to pursue dance at a non toxic studio( whole different story there ). I’m getting shaken up again because like I said earlier, I have a bit of a fear of people leaving me behind, and all my support legs are slipped just as I’m trying to build new ones. I’m so scared of what’s gonna happen, I’m scared of falling back into depression, I want to live but sometimes it doesn’t seem worth it still to this day. I’m scared please help. Everything I’ve done and fought through feels like it’s crumbling and I feel like im gonna retreat back into my shell. I know this was long but I have no other place to turn to and would appreciate some advice.\\n\\n\\nEdit: I also want to get this off my chest, I was in a relationship with a fun quirky guy who made me laugh, we were best friends in a relationship. But when we went to different schools we broke it off. I’ve tried keeping in contact but it kinda connects to me feeling left behind. I know I’m young, people will say it’s stupid but it’s been a year or so and I still miss him, I think I might have even loved him. I don’t know how to move on...I scared of being left behind again.

       " \"I've had alot of this on my mind for a long time. I just need somewhere to write it down and try to see if anyone understands. I've been through alot for only being 19 and my years before age 14 had alot of bad shit connected to it that im not 100% teady to talk about.  At 14 I finally cut contact with my drug addict father after he tried to get my siblings and I taken by the state (again) and get my step dad thrown in jail for false accusations of rape on my little sister. That alone was just a bad time. He called me the night i filed a restraining order to tell me he was going to kill himself and it was my fault, that he hoped i was happy that I caused it. Fast forward 3 months and I was told by my doctor that I have something genetically wring with the muscles and joints in my knees and they needed to do surgery. Fine whatever its just to check on things and I was fine after a week of rest. All they did was clean up scar tissue. However i had just started highschool and was in a junior ROTC program through the army. I was excited and wanted to make a difference that my POS father refused to. I loved this program it was my family and I made really good friends. I joined their shooting team and made it my goal. I got good, really good, too 10 in the nation good . My coach and instructors were ther closest thing to a father I had. I loved them and I felt safe with them. A year goes by and my surgeon tells me he was wrong. He had missed something and thats why I was in pain, he ended up doing an extensive surgery on me at 16, cutting bone and screwing it in at another spot, cutting muscle and ligaments to release pressure and cutting into one of my hamstrings so I wouldn't loose the ability to walk. Recovery for that was terrible. I couldn't walk, couldn't shoot, couldn't do much of anything. I gained probably 40 pounds over my 3 month recovery. I had finally recovered from it and was back in swing and ready for my first big event with my friends. It was an annual ball that the rotc puts on and I was finnally back with my family, couldn't do much but back. I remeber that night because it was one of the last times I felt complete. I was invites to another party a week after but I had to turn it down, my leg wasn't ready and I just couldn't.  I went to sleep early and woke up with over 100 notifications. Come to find out my best friend who had invited me the night before had gotten in an accidnet and died on the way home.I was shaken to my core. His back up driver was shit faced and killed him and it was all becuase I wasn't there. A month later I was at his funeral and we were able to give him a send off to be proud of, all I remember was crying. I had lost one of my two bestfriends, the people who stood by me and had to torn apart relationships in the process of grieving. That excat night another tragedy struck, the third in our trio, a friend of mine sense elementary had passed away from complications with the flu. I was absolutely devastated. I couldn't function. Both of my pillars just died within a month of eachother. I threw myself into shooting and my coach. He was all the support I had left. Fast forward 6 months to the summer. My surgeon had just told me the day before that my other leg needed the same procedure and I could no longer be eligible for military service, the next day I rolled my car down a 30 foot embankment trying to swerve around two dogs. Once I was out of the hospital my coach called me to check on me and told me we would get breakfast after his hiking trip. My coach was epileptic but always loved to go on adventures, he was the classic Jersey stereotype with a heart of gold. I loved that man with everything I had. He was all I felt I had left. He ended up having an episode while hiking and fell of the side of a cliff,  they found his body the next morning on a rock on the river. I was completely devistated, I didnt know what to do but luckily I had made one more friend that I could talk too. I got my second surgery and gained more weight from the depression and lack of movement. This guy became my best friend, helped me through alot and let me vent to him. Flashforward to last month. He is on trial for child sex abuse and has confessdd to it but is now fighting it. I know he is guilty and being a victim of sexual abuse as a child I hate him for it. One of my last friends raped and abused his fathers girlfriend's daughter for years. Here I am now in college across the state and I am beyond lost with no true direction to follow. I want to go home and live closer to my family, but I am engaged and she is from the same town I lived in.

(max dose of fluoxetine is 80mg). so I was taking 40mg of fluoxetine per day) now the doc told me it might cause some tiredness so I always took it at night. after a little while of 40mg, I was still fucked up. I was getting more and more depressed and less and less anxiety. I was getting suicidal and had my phase with self-harm. \\n    \\tSo recently (maybe a month or 2) ago I asked my mom to make a 2nd appointment for my mental health. after conversing with my doctor about how I feel and telling her I\\'ve been taking double the dose, she said that we were gonna keep my dose off fluoxetine with 40mg per day to control the anxiety, and introduce a small dose of Wellbutrin to help with the depression. now Wellbutrin was supposed to perk me up a little and not be tired, so I had high hopes.\\n    \\tAfter a little while on these new drugs (again, month or so) I notice that I am experiencing terrible anxiety when I\\'m at school and as soon as I get home, I\\'m fine for like an hour then I just get incredibly depressed. it\\'s been bad. \\n    \\tI\\'ve tried to keep my head up and not fall back down so I\\'ve researched \"safer\" ways to cause my body harm and still get the pain I need. things like snapping a rubber band on my wrist to the point where it is red and swells up, and also sticking ice on my wrist and leaving it there, this causes pain to the arm and can \"burn\". (yes, an ice burn is a thing). \\n    \\tI\\'ve just been really pissed with the school system lately too because they really teach us the least important shit that we will never use. like yeah, i get they are teaching us to learn but teach us with the important stuff. like I\\'m mature enough, I can learn about taxes and mortgages and stuff. I need that extra challenge to keep me busy, but with my anxiety, my grades do not represent my smarts, so I stay in lower-level classes bored and depressed. I mean you might even be able to tell I\\'m smarter by the way I write this letter. I\\'m in 9th grade... cmon now.\\n    \\n    What should I do? I\\'m going to the doc in 2 weeks. what should I tell her?\\n    Thank you all, I really appreciate it.\\n    -Nick',\n",
